      <p>Description</p>

      <li>Soak the dried beans in a bowl of fresh water with a pinch of salt for about 12 hours until they soften and expand.</li>

      <li>Drain and wash the beans thoroughly. Place them in a pot, cover with fresh water, and boil for approximately one hour until they are slightly soft but still a bit crunchy.</li>

      <li>While the beans boil, prepare the vegetables. Coarsely chop the onion, celery, carrots, garlic, and red pepper into large, rustic chunks.</li>

      <li>In a pan, sauté the onions, celery, carrots, garlic, and red pepper in olive oil. Add the sugar, bay leaves, and cinnamon stick, and cook for about 10 minutes until caramelized.</li>

      <li>Add the tomato paste to the vegetables and sauté briefly to enrich the flavor. Pour in the canned tomatoes, water, a splash of wine, the stock cube, salt, pepper, rosemary, and a squeeze of lemon.</li>

      <li>Drain the boiled beans and place them into a large baking dish. Pour the vegetable and tomato sauce mixture over the beans and mix well.</li>

      <li>Top the mixture with chopped celery leaves, spring onions, and parsley.</li>

      <li>Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (fan setting) for 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>

      <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes to allow a crust to form on the top.</li>

      <li>Serve warm, topped with fresh parsley, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, feta cheese, and a sprinkle of oregano.</li>
