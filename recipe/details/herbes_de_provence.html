        History: This herb blend originated in the Provence region in the
        south of France. At first, the term “herbes de Provence” described a
        general multipurpose mixture of herbs grown in the Provençal region
        during the summer. The blend grew in popularity and became a more
        defined herb mixture in the 1960s when Julia Child included a recipe
        for Poulet Sauté aux Herbes de Provence in her famous cookbook
        Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Child is credited with defining
        the mixture and adding it to the culinary lexicon of chefs all over
        the world. In the 1970s, the French brand Ducros began packaging and
        selling an herbes de Provence spice mix to customers overseas.
