      Notes: For using dried beans: Soak 1 cup of dried beans in a
      large bowl of salted water overnight at room temperature. Rinse
      the beans and cook them in salted water until tender, about 45
      minutes. Drain, spread into a single layer on a towel-lined
      baking sheet, and let them cool. Proceed with recipe as
      directed.
