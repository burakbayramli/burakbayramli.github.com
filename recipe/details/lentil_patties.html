      <p>Description</p>

      <li>Wash the lentils and place them in a pot. Add 3 cups of
      water and boil until they become very soft.</li>
      
      <li>Once the lentils have absorbed all the water, add the bulgur
      and let it sit for about half an hour with the lid on the
      pot.</li>
      
      <li>In a separate pan, sauté the finely chopped onion in the
      vegetable oil until it turns slightly pink. Add the tomato paste
      and continue to sauté for 1-2 more minutes, then remove from the
      heat.</li>
      
      <li>After the lentil and bulgur mixture has rested for half an
      hour, add the sautéed onion and tomato paste mixture. When the
      mixture is cool enough to handle, knead it thoroughly by
      hand.</li>
      
      <li>Add the salt and spices to the kneaded mixture and continue
      to knead until everything is well combined.</li>
      
      <li>Finally, add the finely chopped parsley and green
      onions. Mix everything together well.</li>
      
      <li>Once the mixture has cooled down a bit, take egg-sized
      pieces of the mixture and form them into patties by hand.</li>
      
      <li>Arrange the lentil patties on a plate lined with lettuce or arugula leaves.</li>
