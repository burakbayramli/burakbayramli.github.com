      <p>Description</p>

      <p>
        Prepare the potato marinade by mixing oregano, grated garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, mustard, water, salt, pepper, and olive oil in a large baking pan. Add the potato wedges to the pan and toss by hand to ensure they are thoroughly coated in the marinade.

      <p>
        In a separate bowl, combine the ground meats with the soaked and squeezed bread, grated onion/garlic paste, egg, olive oil, salt, pepper, oregano, and the fresh herbs (parsley and mint). Mix thoroughly until the mixture is uniform and fluffy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shape the meat mixture into about 10 oval patties and nestle them among the potatoes in the baking pan. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and bake in a preheated oven at 190°C (375°F) with the fan on for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for another 20 to 30 minutes until the biftekia are golden and the potatoes are crispy. Serve with a fresh squeeze of lemon and a drizzle of olive oil.
