      <p>Description</p>

      <p>
        Boil vine leaves in water to rid excess salt and soften them up a
        little. The trick of this recipe is being able to match the softness
        of the leaves to the rice, because raw meat and rice mixture will cook
        together with the vine leaves and in the end both should be al dente,
        that is, both should resist to the tooth but not be hard or
        uncooked. Once you drop the leaves into boiling water, check at 5
        minute intervals, they should cook to a bit harder than al-dente, but
        never crunchy nor mushy. The rest is easy, yes, very easy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mix, meat, rice, black pepper, mint, paprika, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1
        tablespoon of tomato paste, red pepper paste, onion and grated
        tomatoes into a doughy texture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Roll small pieces (around 1 teaspoon) of this stuffing into the vine
        leaves as describes in the picture below:

      <p>
        Place stuffed rolls into a wide shallow non-stick or steel pot. If you
        use a steel pot, layer its bottom with spare leaves. You should place
        the rolls next to each other, do not squeeze, but make sure there is
        no space between them. Make no more than 3 layers.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a separate bowl mix the remaining tomato paste, salt and boiling
        water thoroughly. Pour this liquid mixture over stuffed vine
        leaves. With a teaspoon, take small pieces of butter and place them
        evenly onto the vine rolls.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cover the pot and put on high heat for a few minutes until it boils,
        bring the heat to the lowest and continue cooking until it absorbs all
        the water and becomes oily and shiny. Taste one sarma to see if rice
        and leaves has cooked thoroughly. If still not cooked enough, add half
        a cup of boiling water and keep cooking till the stuffed rolls absorb
        that too. Remove from the heat when done, let rest for half an
        hour. Serve warm-hot with yogurt (this is a must).
