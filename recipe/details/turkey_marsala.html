      <p>Description</p>

      <p>Slice turkey breasts. Slice the chicken breasts in half lengthwise,
      making 4 thinner cutlets. This helps the chicken cook faster and more
      uniformly. And if your slices end up uneven, pound the bigger cutlet
      into the same size as the other so they’re even. This has happened to
      me several times, so don’t panic if it does!</p>

      <p>Season the chicken. Mix the flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish
      or bowl. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture, coating both sides
      and place them on a separate plate.</p>

      <p>Sear the chicken. Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over
      medium-high heat. Sear the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes per side, until
      it has a nice golden crust. It’s okay if it’s not fully cooked
      through, as it will simmer again with the sauce. Then, use tongs to
      remove the chicken to a plate.</p>

      <p>Sauté the mushrooms. Melt the remaining butter in the pan, add the
      mushrooms, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until
      lightly browned. Then, add the garlic and shallot and saute for
      another 30 seconds.</p>

      <p>Make the sauce. Add the broth, Marsala wine, and heavy cream to
      deglaze the pan. Stir together and bring the liquid to a boil, then
      lower the heat and simmer until it’s thickened and reduced by half,
      about 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

      <p>Return the chicken. Add the chicken back to the pan, spoon the sauce
      over it, and simmer until the chicken is warmed through, about 2 to 3
      minutes. Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley and serve this with any
      of the delicious options below!</p>

      <p>Note: Marsala wine is a fortified wine from Sicily, Italy, known for
      its rich, nutty, and slightly sweet flavor. It’s used mainly in
      cooking and baking, but can also be enjoyed as an aperitif. It comes
      in dry (secco), semi-dry (semi-secco), and sweet (dolce) varieties,
      but for chicken marsala, grab a dry or semi-dry bottle to complement
      the savory flavors in this dish.</p>
