      <p>Description</p>

      <p>
        Sauté the finely chopped onion in olive oil with a pinch of salt for about 8 minutes until soft and golden. Add the thinly sliced leeks (cleaned in cold water) and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Add the grated garlic and cook until fragrant, about 10 to 20 seconds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stir in the cubed potatoes, pureed tomatoes, dried dill, salt, pepper, and one cup of water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until the potatoes are fork-tender, which usually takes 20 to 30 minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Add the chopped spinach in batches, allowing each batch to wilt before adding more. Once all the spinach is wilted and the potatoes are fully cooked, stir in the lemon juice. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil before serving. Serve warm with toasted bread and optional feta cheese.
