      <p>Description</p>

      <p>Trim the ends of the washed green beans and cut them into 3-4 pieces. If using wide runner beans, slice them lengthwise down the middle first.</p>

      <p>Heat the olive oil in a pot and sauté the diced onions until they become translucent and slightly golden.</p>

      <p>Add the tomato paste, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper to the onions and mix well. Add the diced tomatoes and continue to sauté for a couple of minutes.</p>

      <p>Add the green beans to the pot and mix thoroughly. Cover the lid and cook on low heat until the beans lose their firmness and begin to soften, stirring occasionally.</p>

      <p>Once the beans have changed color and softened, pour in 2 cups of hot water. Let it simmer until the beans are completely tender.</p>

      <p>Serve hot or warm. Enjoy your meal!</p>
