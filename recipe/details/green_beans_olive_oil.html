    <h3>Green Beans in Olive Oil</h3>

    <div>
      <p>Ingredients </p>

      <li>1/4 cup of olive oil</li>
      <li>1 medium onions, finely diced</li>
      <li>1 cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 kilogram of fresh green beans</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>2 medium tomatoes</li>
      
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>Description</p>

      <li>Cut of the tips of all beans, place them in the pot.</li>

      <p>Add the onions, and tomatoes as a layer on top of it. Add salt.</p>

      <p>Pour the olive oil trying to evenly distriute it on the beans as much as possible.</p>

      <p>Cover the lid, and cook at medium heat, until the beans change color, become darker and soften. 
      If necessary add a few spoons of water if the pot runs out of water,
