      <p>Description</p>

      <p>Soak the dried beans for the piyaz in water the night before. If you are using pre-boiled beans, skip the first two steps.</p>

      <p>The next day, drain the water from the beans, wash them, and place them in a pot. Add enough water to cover them by about two fingers' width and leave them to boil. Cook for 35-40 minutes, checking to ensure they are tender but not so soft that they fall apart.</p>

      <p>Drain the boiled beans and, once they have cooled, transfer them to a deep bowl. Add the picked parsley leaves you have prepared.</p>

      <p>Thinly slice the red onions into half-moons and add them to the bowl. Sprinkle the salt, add the lemon juice and vinegar over them.</p>

      <p>Finally, add the remaining spices and the olive oil, and mix well.</p>

      <p>You can serve the piyaz cold or warm with a boiled egg, if desired. The piyaz is ready. Enjoy your meal</p>
