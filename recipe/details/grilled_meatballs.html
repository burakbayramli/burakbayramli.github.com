      <p>Description</p>

      <p>
      Mix all in a bowl, by hand, as if making bread out of flour and
      water.

      Once it has enough sticky consistency, cover the bown and leave
      it to rest in the refigrator for one hour, or overnight.

      With the mixture grab egg sized pieces from it, create round
      meatballs, then flatten them by pressing from each side by hand.

      With the flattened meatballs ready, place one tablespoon olive
      oil on a pan, bring to medium heat, put meatballs on the
      pan. Fry for 5-10 minutes, turning other side so they cook
      equally.

      Serve hot.
