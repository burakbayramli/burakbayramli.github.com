      Wash the red lentils, rice, and bulgur. Pour olive oil into a a
      medium-sized steel pot. Finely chop the onion and add it to the
      pot. Cut the garlic into rice-grain-sized pieces and add
      them. After adding the tomato and red pepper paste, place the
      pot over medium heat.

      Stir the ingredients continuously with a wooden spoon and saut√©
      for 4-5 minutes. Transfer the washed and strained lentils,
      bulgur, and rice into the pot. Pour 8-10 cups of hot water over
      them. Sprinkle in the mint, salt, black pepper, and red pepper
      flakes, and stir again. After adding the lemon juice, let
      the soup cook.

      If you're using a regular pot, remove the soup from the heat
      25-30 minutes after it starts to boil. Use a blender to mix,
      thin the soup. Serve hot.
