      <p>Description</p>

      <li>Rinse and drain the spinach thoroughly. Lightly trim the roots and chop the spinach, including the stems, into normal-sized pieces.</li>
      <li>Finely chop the onion and saut√© it in a little olive oil.</li>
      <li>Once the onions are lightly browned, add the tomato paste and stir.</li>
      <li>Add the chopped spinach and salt.</li>
      <li>Cover and let it cook on medium heat. (I don't add water because spinach releases its own water while cooking. You can add a little if it seems too dry.)</li>
      <li>Once the spinach is tender, turn off the heat and let it
      rest. Serve it warm or cold, mixed with yoghurt if you wish. Enjoy your meal!      </li>
