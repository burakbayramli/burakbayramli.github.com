          <h2>How It Works</h2>

          <p>Recommender system has become a rising topic as we demand
          more customized contents push to our daily feeds. I guess we
          are all familiar with the recommended videos on YouTube, and
          we are all — more than once — the victims of late-night
          Netflix binge watching.</p>

          <p>There are two popular methods in recommender system,
          collaborative based filtering and content based
          filtering. Content based filtering makes predictions of what
          the audience is likely to prefer based on the content
          properties, e.g. genre, language, video length. Whereas
          collaborative filtering predicts based on what other similar
          users also prefer. As the result, collaborative filtering
          method is leaning towards instance based learning and
          usually applied by large companies with huge amount of data
          at hand.</p>

          <P>In this article, I will focus on collaborative based
          filtering and briefly introduce how to make movie
          recommendation using two algorithms that fall into this
          category, K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Singular Value
          Decomposition (SVD)</p>
