<h3>31</h3>
<p>
The combinaton of your Sun sign and your Moon sign produces a personality that
is ethereal, lighthearted, bright and totally enjoyable. You have a clever sense
of humor and active wit. In a very charming way, you can persuade and cajole the
people in your life to usually come around to your way of thinking. This
placement is very favorable for having many very influential friends and a
professional career of some sort. You don't, however, have much taste for really
hard work, especially when this requires much concentration and sustained
effort. You lead an active life in which you combine business and pleasure to
good advantage. You are very independent and never like to feel beholden to
anyone or any obligation. While you can force yourself to do about anything, no
one else has much luck trying to stimulate your sense of duty or
obligation. Life never seems dull to you because you stay so busy traveling (you
love to travel), socializing, working and playing, as you please. Although you
are somewhat high-strung, nothing keeps your moods in a depressed state for very
long. Expressive, artistic, and able to communicate on many levels, you are a
natural extrovert. You are such a good conversationalist that your stories
sometimes become very detailed, complex, and long. Romantically, you may be
somewhat fickle, and very demanding of complete justice in all your
relationships.
