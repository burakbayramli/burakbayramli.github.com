<h3>6</h3>
<p>
Your sign shows that you are very cool emotionally. A fine critical
nature seems to replace a good deal of the impetuosity often
associated with Aries. You are likely to have a mind that is channeled
into practical matters, and you have a "no nonsense" attitude about
most issues. Effeciency is all important to you. You have a driving
determination to get things done, and to get them done right. You are
definitely an achiever, combining your cool-headed judgment and the
energy to put your thoughts into action. You may be lacking in
creativity and originality, but you readily absorb knowledge and put
it to use in a very efficient way. You figure things out from every
angle and never overlook the smallest detail. You're hard to work for,
because you're so exacting. You can be very pointed in your manner of
criticizing a half-finished job or work that in any way reveals
unacceptable quality. You are potentially a very fine executive if you
can keep from making too many enemies with your aggressive and
critical nature. You're not a romantic or a socially outgoing person,
and you may even be something of a "lone wolf" type.
