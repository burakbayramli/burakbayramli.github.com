<h3>20</h3>
<p>
You have a personality possessing a good deal more emotional intensity
that is normally observed in the very stable Taurus Sun sign native. A
very attractive cover hides the emotionally temperamental side of your
nature. There is a very "definite" quality about you that insists
black is black and white is white, and the many shades of gray don't
exist. You have a very strong and passionate nature that knows what it
wants and how to get it. You are very headstrong, self-willed, and
independent. Your charm is instantaneous, and this coupled with your
dramatic flare, shows talent for acting and speaking. You like being
noticed and there is nothing at all timid about you. You are very
appealing to the opposite sex, but the temperament you release when
your reserve breaks down can make personal relationships very
stormy. With all the tools that you have to get ahead, it wouldn't be
hard for you to go far. Strangely however, your ambition to do so may
not be as strong as many of your competitor who you pass along the way
may believe. The tension that seems always to be building up
constantly produces the urge to get away from it all and let yourself
completely relax. You need this reprieve to avoid the stress to which
you are rather susceptible.
