<h3>220</h3>
<p>
You know how to get to your goals in life by steady, patient, and persistent
progress. You have good, practical overviews of the final result of your
efforts. You are good at planning a strategy and sticking to it. You build your
projects and your life with bedrock security in mind, with as little risk as
possible. Discipline, patience, hard work, and the blessing of good judgment
work together to form a picture that looks like "luck" to others. 

<br/><br/>

Mars sextile Saturn or Mars trine Saturn: *You possess the gifts of endurance
and perseverance, the willingness to work hard and seriously to achieve your
objectives. Once you decide you want something or make a commitment, you'll do
it "even if it takes forever". Self-discipline is natural to you and you
instinctively realize that any creative achievement is "10% inspiration, 90%
perspiration". You choose practical, realistic goals and pursue them
step-by-step in a well-planned, orderly way. You like to concentrate on one
thing at a time and do a thorough job. You enjoy working in solitude, and often
feel your best work is done when you are alone.

<br/><br/>

You may find that you go from one transformational situation to another, never
really settling into any one thing. Yet you have the endurance necessary for the
long haul.
