<h3>176</h3>
<p>
It is easy and natural for those born under a harmonious aspect between the Sun
and Uranus to embrace new ways of doing things, to stick up for the underdog,
and to express themselves in unique and inspiring ways. These people don't have
to try to stand out as unique--they are original, creative, and progressive
without trying. Although these people question rules and traditions if they
don't seem to make sense to them, they don't view them as threatening their
personal sense of freedom.

<br/><br/>

These individuals are far from pretentious. They value honesty and truth, and
they avoid putting on airs. They believe in the equality of people, and easily
relate to people from all walks of life. There is an unmistakable enthusiasm
about life, and generally the life is interesting because the natives invite
unusual or adventurous experiences into their lives. They are generally
appreciated by others because they are open-minded, fair, and not
judgmental. Nothing really seems to faze them! They take things in stride, and
are rarely shocked or taken aback by human behavior. If you are holding onto
something that you keep to yourself for fear that if you talk about it, someone
will think you're strange, you can safely turn to a Sun-Uranus person. They
probably won't blink, and they'll make you feel quite alright about it.
