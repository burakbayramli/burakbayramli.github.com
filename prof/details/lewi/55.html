<h3>55</h3>
<p>
Your sign produces a very independent, idealistic and romantic
person. You have a warmhearted, almost sentimental approach to
life. You are highly honorable and have a sense of your
integrity. Conventional and traditional, you have a tolerant and
logical approach to life, and a healthy respect for public opinion. As
straightforward as you are, there is much that you don't reveal about
yourself in a first meeting. You are a bit elusive and hard to pin
down. You may know what people want of you, but your method is usually
to put a good bit of thought in your actions and not always commit
yourself too soon. People have respect for your opinion because it is
not the first one rendered and generally is well thought out and
solidly founded. You are not one to go overboard or fall prey to any
sort of extremes. Besides this capacity for clear, methodical
thinking, you also may be blessed with a gift of creativity and
imagination. Art and drama may appeal to you. There is much that is
dramatic and appealing in your makeup. You can live almost
independently, and the emotional depth necessary in relationships can
be somewhat lacking in you at times. Complex emotionalism can cause
you to retreat and become a bit aloof. You are an avid observer of
human nature, but not one to want to get too deeply involved.
