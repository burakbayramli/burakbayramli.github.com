<h3>238</h3>
<p>
It is almost like there is an invisible force helping you in life. You succeed
in plans when others fail, and if you have other conjuncts of Saturn or Uranus
in your zodiac, you will see your plans to completion very quickly. If you
possess 163 or 180, your appeal and concentration powers will combine to provide
you almost magical successes in life. If you are an artist, engineer, architect,
politician or a military leader, your work will always stand out from others. 

<br/><br/>


<br/><br/>

If there are conjunts or squares to both planets, or if your zodiac has 156 or
175, you will be someone who can get the attention of others. You have a quality
that inspires people which makes people support you and bring success to your
doorstep.
