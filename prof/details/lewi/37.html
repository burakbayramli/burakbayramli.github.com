<h3>37</h3>
<p>
Your sign gives you a quick mind and a remarkable memory. You are a
person with much self-respect and determination. Yet this never seems
to make you at all self-centered or insensitive to others. In fact,
you are very sensitive to everyone, and you live by the code "Do unto
others as you would. . ." There is no great complexity about your
emotions. They are just near the surface, and as a rule, do become
easily aroused. If offended, you often reply with a quick and ever so
intense emotional reaction. But there is not much depth to this
temper, and you become quickly cooled and back to normal. Emotions are
quick and changeable. Sometimes you say things before thinking that
you later regret. This is unfortunate, because your intentions are
usually sterling. Although you mean the best and you'll go into
battles for your friends, you're not so good at respecting their
ideas. You may dismiss such ideas and principles before really giving
them any thought. You are anything but a naive person, and about the
only way you can be fooled is by playing to your emotions. Your nature
is a little on the suspicious side. You seem to succeed much more
readily working in some humanistic profession or artistic endeavor,
rather than in a business. People and ideas appeal more than money.
