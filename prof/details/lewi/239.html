<h3>239</h3>
<p>
This is very similar to 238. This sextile will bring more creativity and will
help in artistic creations. If you have such an occupation, it will bring forth
a "practical idealism" which will make your creations more earthy. Arthur
Rackhamm who also has this sextile, is a good example for this.

<br/><br/>

An artist or not, this sextile will provides a "hard to describe" monetary
benefit in your life which will be long lasting.
