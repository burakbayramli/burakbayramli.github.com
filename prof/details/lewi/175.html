<h3>175</h3>
<p>
It is easy and natural for those born under a harmonious aspect between the Sun
and Saturn to accept responsibilities, to lead a rather ordered life, and to
apply caution in their financial and business dealings. They rarely jump to
conclusions or take uneducated risks. They have a certain amount of patience and
enough self-discipline to slowly but surely achieve what they set out to
do. Although somewhat undemonstrative, they are generally loyal and responsible
people to those they care about.

<br/><br/>

These are not the quickest-moving people around - they take their time and
generally use a step-by-step approach to most projects, but they steadily reach
their goals. Sun sextile and trine Saturn people are naturally trustworthy, and
they don't have much patience for those who don't show respect for others, who
take foolish risks, and who lead disorganized lives. With the trine, all of
these traits come naturally. With the sextile, these traits are available when
they are needed.
