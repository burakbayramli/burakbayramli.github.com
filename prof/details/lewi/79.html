<h3>79</h3>
<p>
You have a highly romantic personality and a somewhat mystic faith in
other people. You are perhaps a bit gullible and easily influenced
because of a tendency to be too trusting. You thrive on love,
attention, and dreams, and often you seem to live in a dream
world. You are an optimist that refuses to look on the dark side of
any issue. This combination shows a very harmonious nature, rarely
holding to any extreme position. You are naturally very refined,
highly artistic, intuitive and peaceful. Slow to make decisions, you
like to justify things in your mind before you commit yourself to
others. You like to get balance and harmony in all things. Your
strength lies in an ability to make adjustments or to compromise. You
can easily see the other persons view of an issue and make an
impartial judgment. Inconstancy and vacillation is something you may
have to deal with, and you should try to establish and hold to goals
and objectives in your life or business endeavors. You are a very
friendly person, and you can get far in life with an attitude that is
ever polite and amiable. Your good taste and sense for the artistic
also will take you far in many fields in which these traits are
important. Your natural impulses and feelings about things keep you on
the right track, and you instinctively say and do the right
things. With these attributes, it not necessary for you to be too
active or to aggressive, and you aren't.
