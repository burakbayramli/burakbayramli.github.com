<h3>199</h3>
<p>
Your mind is full of fantasies and illusions. It is hard for you to be objective
and concrete with your ideas and you tend to be disorderly and lose
concentration on your studies. Your extreme sensitivity may lead you to retreat
to your fantasy world when you feel disappointed or hurt. Because of your
creative and imaginative mind, you can excel in artistic achievements where you
will communicate your ideas more easily. If you have grown up in a stable and
harmonious home you will avoid your escapist tendency.

<br/><br/>

Your mind is highly imaginative and creative and you possess dramatic,
artistic, or musical abilities. As a child, you enjoyed daydreaming,
fantasizing, pretending, and probably lived in "your own little world"
a good deal. You perceive things which are not obvious to other people
and you have an uncanny ability to "read" people and situations
without being told anything about them. However, you must learn to
discriminate between a true psychic perception and your
imagination. Learning to discipline and focus your mind is necessary
if you wish to use all of your creative potential. Otherwise, you
could be simply a dreamer.

<br/><br/>

Communication with others is difficult for you because you often find words
frustrating and inadequate to express your experiences and perceptions. Also,
you may purposefully mystify or deceive others.
