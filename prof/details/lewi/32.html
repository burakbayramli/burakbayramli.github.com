<h3>32</h3>
<p>
Your sign produces an intellectual quickness and an emotional depth
that makes you an exceptionally forceful, magnetic, and versatile
person. You are especially quick and active, while being extremely
receptive and tuned in to other people. Surprisingly, these
exceptional traits may not necessarily make you the leader that is
implied. With all this strength, you are easily persuaded and
influenced, and sometimes led astray or distracted from doing what you
might be thought capable of doing. You're never opposed to taking a
chance or getting out on a limb. Sensationalism is always appealing to
you, and this is reflected in your actions, and perhaps in the friends
you select, as well. You may expend a good deal of your energies
chasing personal pleasures rather than keeping your nose to the
grindstone. You can pursue any project with such great intensity, but
never for any long periods of time. Overindulging and getting your
finger to too many pies can result in problems if you aren't careful,
and you are not one who is is usually very careful. There is little
you couldn't do if you could get your mental and emotional nature
pulling together in the same constructive direction.
