<h3>75</h3>
<p>
You have a very airy and magnetic personality, voluble, expressive,
talkative, with an ability to hold an audience. Dramatics are your
specialty and you know how to get your point across with flair. This
combination blends the emotional balance, courtesy and friendliness of
Libra with the intellectual cleverness, flexibility and adaptability
of Gemini. Success is gained through a wide array of intellectual
interest and self-expression. You don't dive deeply into any subjects,
but you have a sharp mind that penetrates quickly and accurate. You
may work your mind overtime, but otherwise you don't believe much in
hard work. You can be hard to pin down and draw out of the
clouds. Glibness and social poise attach to this position. You don't
like to take on responsibility and you don't work well under
pressure. Restless and nervous, you need to be kept busy and
occupied. You can see both sides of any question and at time you have
some difficult making up your mind. You definitely belong to the
intellectual group and you may feel that there should be no limit to
the amount of education one obtains. You have a sense of balance or
equilibrium, tending to keep affairs harmonious and pleasant.
