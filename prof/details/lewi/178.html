<h3>178</h3>
<p>
There is an unmistakable competitiveness and a "me-first" attitude with those
who have Sun square or opposition Mars in their natal charts. The fighter
persona is most apparent in youth, when the child is described as a "bundle of
energy", or it is remarked that he or she "can't sit still". The abundant energy
generated by the hard aspects (especially the square) between the Sun and Mars
is hard to direct in childhood. Later in life, ideally, those with these aspects
have learned to channel some of their excess energy into productive
avenues--perhaps through career, sports, or any area where competitiveness is
considered an asset. Nevertheless, people with these aspects can meet up with
more than their share of conflict, and they can most certainly rub people the
wrong way. They are very motivated to get things done, to take action rather
than simply talk about something, and to get from point A to point B as quickly
as possible. Those who know them quite well might describe these people as
hot-headed and temperamental at times. They are easily frustrated, and they're
given to impulsive actions and assertion of their wills. If the aspect is found
in cardinal signs, it gives impulsiveness and a short temper. If the aspect is
found in fixed signs, the natives can be very hard-headed and willful. If it's
in mutable signs, it gives a restless and frustrated impatience.

<br/><br/>

Essentially, those with Sun square Mars in their charts have faced conflict and
are not particularly afraid of it. They have faced having their need to assert
themselves blocked. Their parents may have done as much as they could to "tame"
what they felt to be excess energy or aggression. In other words, they know all
about conflict and blockages, so that when they are faced with a challenge or a
roadblock, they don't run away from it or hide under the covers feeling sorry
for themselves. They meet challenges head-on.

<br/><br/>

Sun opposition Mars people are more confrontational and argumentative than
active. In youth, they might feel that they often face anger from others. They
might see the Mars energy as coming from the outside. If and when they face the
fact that the aggression is actually a part of their own personalities, they are
more equipped to direct the competitive energy into productive avenues.
