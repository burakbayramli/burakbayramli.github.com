<h3>132</h3>
<p>
You have a mind that is very original and able to grasp the most
vague, ethereal and extreme concepts. The blend mixes friendliness,
originality and independence of Aquarius with the emotional
sensitivity and imagination of Pisces. You are a person who is
naturally persevering and conscientious, being interested in detail,
method and order. Your way of reacting to the world is very
interesting. You can spend days just dreaming and speculating. You are
fascinated by the unusual and the abstract, finding it interesting to
take up studies in any number of bazaar topics. Loving to read and
study, you may become very well informed on a wide variety of
subjects. You lean heavily on your hunches and way out ideas, and
you're easily distracted from routine work. You dream a lot and you
have an utter faith in the dreams you dream. Your mind can get so far
afield on some vaguely related tangent that you may even forget what
the task at hand originally was. Your perceptions are so vividly acute
that it is often not practical to pay attention to all of them. You
live a private life of your own, into which few others ever
penetrate. A keen imagination or a sort of mental vision allows you to
be good money-maker in a variety of fields; you seem to be able to
intuitively realize possibilities and take advantage of them. You
success relies on talent and intelligence since you don't project a
particularly strong leadership personality. There is a tendency for
you to let things drift. At times you should display a more forceful
will, but by and large you develop a very pronounced prudence and
sense of caution. You can benefit in overcoming or controlling a
tendency to accept things in a passive way, or in being too friendly
and obliging if others incline to take advantage of your good nature.
