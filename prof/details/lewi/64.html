<h3>64</h3>
<p>
Your sign shows a sensitive, but harmonious personality; one that can
think and feel very deeply. The intelligence, analytical insight, and
discrimination of Virgo, blends well with the emotional sensitivity of
Cancer. You have a receptive temperament often deeply influenced by
outside conditions or other people with whom you come in
contact. Inwardly you are practical and discriminating, but outwardly
you seem changeable. The combination of practical intelligence with
feeling and a vivid imagination, can support success with relative
ease. An intuitive insight into facts and details allows you to often
"feel" the truth of an issue. Your have a good sense of values and
find it easy to know what things are worth. Your intuitive knowledge
of human psychology, and of the things people are interested in or
will buy, supports progress and opportunity in business. Security
means a good deal to you, and to some extent you can emphasize
protective and defensive instincts in your affairs and activities. You
form close attachments to those people who are near you, but you're
ever shy around those you don't know so well. Reserved and perhaps
even a little timid, you project a conservative attitude. You are
attached to traditions, convention, and habit, with change being a
concept that you accept slowly.
