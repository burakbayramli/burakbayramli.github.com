There is a conflict here between the head and the heart. The emotions tell them
one thing and the mind tells them something else. The result is a wavering, and
a see-saw effect is most evident with the opposition--emotional to the point of
irrationality at one moment, and logical the next. How to blend the head and the
heart is a constant struggle for these individuals, usually because there is a
tendency to resist blending them!

These people love to chat, enjoy story-telling and writing/poetry, and usually
possess a sparkling wit! They are animated when they speak, and have a sense of
humor that others appreciate simply because it's very imaginative. Some are
especially adept at satire. You can usually tell their moods by how much they're
talking. When nervous or excitable, they talk up a storm. Moodiness is a
characteristic, definitely, and an especially subjective nature makes them prone
to hypersensitivity. It usually has to do with the fact that they take in so
very much from their environment. This is also one of the reasons why they tend
to be indecisive. While Mercury conjunct Moon people tend to be quite
consistently rational, the hard aspects of Moon-Mercury generate a swing between
irrational and rational thoughts and feelings. This rarely transfers into
action, however. It's pretty much something that takes place "upstairs" in the
mind, although others are sure to see the struggle from time to time. These
people are always interesting, and usually funny. They have a tendency to
misrepresent themselves with what they say from time to time, but they're
charming, if a little kooky, friends.
