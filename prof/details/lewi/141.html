<h3>141</h3>
<p>
You have a personality that is never content with earthy,
materialistic, or mundane goals. Your stride is long, smoothly
sweeping, and unwilling to settle for less than the best. You are
willing to try anything possible to achieve your goals. The influence
of these signs is most idealistic and high-minded. Your vision of
acceptable is to most, the impossible dream. A certain spiritual
quality attaches to everything you do. Unfortunately, it's hard to
live comfortably on such a high plane of existence. The "sage" aspect
of Sagittarius combines effectively with the Pisces fluid expression
of mind, spirit and emotions producing wisdom that is freely expressed
with great feeling. This is not to say that you are always practical
and constructive. Too much of the time your ideas are vague,
hypothetical, and intangible. In many ways you are the impractical
visionary, thinking in broad, general terms rather than dealing with
specifics and details. You are a highly expansive person and may try
to spread your energies far too thin. Definitely, you are not a
materialist, perfectly satisfied so long as the world gives you a
living to go on with your important work. You are an idealist through
and through and have some of the naivete that attaches to idealism, in
spite of your intuitive wisdom.
