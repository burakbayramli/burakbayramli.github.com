<h3>44</h3>
<p>
You have a forceful and temperamental personality. Your emotions are
so near the surface that it takes more than the ordinary amount of
understanding to reach you. You are intense and somewhat dramatic in
your actions. Though not necessarily the life of the party, you do
have a certain magnetic appeal and commanding demeanor. This draws
people to you in the political, educational, or social arena of
life. You are not so popular as you are impelling. When your feelings
stay out of your way, there is no limit to what you can
accomplish. But when the sensitive side of your nature does come into
play, you can be equally destructive. You can show extremes of
concentration on a purpose and a very dedicated devotion to duty. You
are never the type to be unkind or mean. You have a deep sense of
protectiveness, most for your family or for those friends to whom you
are particularly close. You are not the idealist, but rather are
attracted to the practical dollars and cents issues and personal
worldly ambitions. The romantic side of your nature is ardent,
demonstrative and lavish in affections, but apt to be extremely
jealous if given a cause. Defensive behavior is strongly marked in
your nature, and you seem to have your feelers out for threatening
vibrations almost all the time.
