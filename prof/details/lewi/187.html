<h3>187</h3>
<p>
You get a new idea every minute and have difficulty waiting to express it. You
are truly innovative and original in your thought process. While you are
nervous, you do have good mechanical aptitude. If you can get control of your
hands and mind, you can be quite inventive. You have a love for technical
subjects and do your best work while blazing new trails on the frontiers of
knowledge. Most of your difficulties stem from situations that require you to be
regular, ordinary, and consistent, conforming to everyone else's
procedures. Unfortunately for you, a certain amount of traditional training is
necessary or no one will understand how good your ideas really are. You have a
flood of New Age information in you. You need to find a way to express it. 

<br/><br/>

An independent and original thinker, you are excited by new ideas,
discoveries, and innovations. Your mind functions in an intuitive,
nonlinear fashion, and sudden insights and ideas often come to you
"out of the blue". You grasp ideas very quickly and often become
impatient with those who are slower or more cautious than
yourself. You are considered rather eccentric and unusual in your
interests by more conservative minds. You do well in an open,
unpredictable atmosphere where flexibility and quick responses are
needed. You have an aptitude for science, mathematics, electronics, or
astrology.
