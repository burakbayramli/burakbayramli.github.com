<h3>254</h3>
<p>
You usually aren't someone who satisfies emotionally as your needs are quite
deep and substantial. You are ready to take any risk to satisfy them. Your
feelings of security are not based tradition, you are more interested in what
you can do personally. Outwardly, you might seem balanced and/or even cold, but
this exterior hides an internal conflict. You need to inspect this turbulance
and control it. You need to get to know your almost unlimited reserve of love,
and once you get to know it, this will help you to find someone whose internal
reserves are as vast as yours. Any early marriage you make in order to satisfy
others, will turn out to be disappointing for you since it will not satisfy your
real needs. You must seperate early from your family in order to build your
dependence and character. An overly protective mother might be a big handicap
for you that will stop both your character and skill development.
