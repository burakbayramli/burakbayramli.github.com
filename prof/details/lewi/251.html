<h3>251</h3>
<p>
You tend to overreact to things. You might something you like the prime center
of your life an utterly ignore or attack something you hate. You get attached to
people, ideas, or anything that excite you with an unbalanced fervor. You like
to experience life however you also build protective walls which stop people
around you from understanding you. Gaining control of oneself and/or others
might turn to be your life's goal. In any walk of life, it doesn't seem like you
are someone who takes a backseat. With this angle, both the positive and
negative attributes of your sun sign will get stronger and propagate to the
world, for this reason, you will have a hard time to make changes or will try
hard to stop them if outside conditions impose them on you.
