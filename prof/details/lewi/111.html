<h3>111</h3>
<p>
You have a very mentally ambitious personality. You are likely to be
very studious and interested in developing your talent for
self-expression in respect to writing or public speaking. A lot of
mental curiosity keeps you alert to new ideas and simulates your
interest in learning. The Gemini Moon makes you flexible, versatile,
and adaptable. This shows up mostly in your mental quickness; you are
such a fast learner, swiftly assimilating impressions and ideas and
making quick decisions. Your variable nature is also shown by the
number of times you change your mind, your opinions, and your
ideas. You are always so clever, never at a loss for words and this is
the talent you can really build a reputation on. A good planner and
organizer, you have much personal ingenuity and inventiveness
producing a constant stream of new ideas and methods. Your talent in
all forms of self-expression may guide you to some type of work that
involves writing, or in the field of advertising. With you outwardly
glib, witty and clever personality, it's surprising that you are
really rather serious, practical and ambitious. In fact, at times, you
worry a bit too much and allow anxieties to assume an undue
proportion. Then you can be volatile and buoyant and act as though you
didn't have a care in the world. Emotionally, you are a puzzle to
yourself and certainly to those around you; inwardly sound, reliable,
and practical, outwardly, changeable and contradictory.
