<h3>15</h3>
<p>
Your sign gives an affinity for sociability, and a definite air of
simple pleasantness marks your personality. The contrasting elements
of slowness of Taurus and speed of Gemini generally produces a Taurus
person more apt to make errors of judgment. The natural trait of
stubbornness may still be present, but the Gemini Moon often shows a
tendency to jump rather quickly to conclusions and the natural Taurus
fixity is not nearly so apparent. But sometimes trouble can arise when
you form a quick opinion and do hold to it, no matter what. You are
mentally alert, but apt to lack the great memory usually possessed by
Taurus natives. There is an ever present tendency with this pairing to
be too critical of other people. This is the most restless and fickle
of the Taurus combinations. You may find yourself constantly jumping
into friendships and romances, finding reasons why the other person is
not right for you. Continuous challenge and stimulation is required to
keep your undivided attention. You need more education that most
people because study and learning steadies your nature. Your capacity
for attainment increases in direct ratio with your interest in study
and education. Fortunately, your intellectual tendencies probably
endow you with good abilities or talents. You're apt to show
especially good verbal skills; speaking and writing. With education
you can be less restless and more contented. The mind is always
needing something tangible and concrete with which to relate. Keeping
yourself mentally busy is very important for you.
