<h3>144</h3>
<p>
Your sign produces a dualistic personality and one that is quite
difficult for the world to easily understand. You are highly
introspective, almost to the extent that the outer world around you
seems odd and full of what you perceive as weird notions. A tendency
to withdraw, makes you strangely inaccessible at times. Yet you have a
very warm and likable quality when you allow yourself to open up to
others and let these traits show. You have an enormous faith in your
intuition and your self-sufficiency, but at the same time, you value
close relationships and social activity. For the most part the double
Pisces is amenable, acutely interested in others, and a trustworthy
friend.

<br/><br/>

In handling your work, you are by nature very painstaking and accurate in
detail. You are loyal to your duties and fulfilling obligations. Mentally you
are quick, perceptive, intuitive, with an almost mystic belief in your
hunches. Insight and creativity is your great strength. You have an uncanny way
of seeing the core and substance of things, making you both motivational and a
universal-thinker. Artisitic performance is often your forte.
