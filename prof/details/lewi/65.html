<h3>65</h3>
<p>
You have a very earnest, if contradictory personality. The pairing
blends the intelligence, analytical insight and discrimination of
Virgo, with the vitality, confidence and authoritativeness of
Leo. There is much internal indecision in your nature, but the Virgo
personality is sure to rule. You do what you should, instead of what
you would. You are naturally conscientious, revealing great working
capacity or devotion to duty. You have a very confident and positive
personality, often proving assertive, sometimes aggressive. Your
assertive impulses may cause you to spend some time worrying when you
later take the time to reflect and analyze what you have said or
done. You feel better when you can hold back until you have that inner
confidence that the direction you're headed is correct. You're a
person of very high character and strong principles. You rely on
individual worth and expect others to recognize your sincerity, and
they usually do. You have a practical individuality and a
discriminating nature. Your strengths of character and high principles
should help you attain your potentials in life.
