Your personality seems to be on a perpetual see-saw. You go up when
you would prefer to go down and vise versa. You'll give in to the
wishes of others, without really knowing why. It's difficult to
predict how you will react to anything, because you always seem to be
asking yourself if you should do what you want or what everyone else
wants you to do. Most of the time you do what others want you to do,
whether or not you are in agreement. Your personality blends the
emotional sensitivity and feelings of Pisces with the warmth and
aggressiveness of Leo. Your personality blends the emotional
sensitivity and feelings of Pisces with the warmth and assertiveness
of Leo. You're likely to be more positive and forceful than people
perceive you, making you seem somewhat variable or contradictory. On
the surface you may seem to be a pillar of strength, but you are
easily swayed. Personal relationships are extremely important to
you. You are not necessarily a clinger, but you do depend on others
for your happiness and good spirits. Depression comes easily to
you. You can be happy one moment, and the next you can be tired, sad,
and blue. You respond best to people when you are confident of your
status, and you have a hard time maintaining your spirit when you are
surrounded with people that you consider your superiors. The moment
you are bested is the moment you turn sour; pressure, tension and
competition are hard for you to handle. For this reason, you are best
when you choose a position providing some authority wherein you can
present your positive and aggressive personality more or less freely,
gaining from your talent of being popular and well liked. Your strong
point is your amiable and lovable personality. You're not really a
competitor, but no one can challenge you in the field of being
likable.
