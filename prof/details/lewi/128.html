<p>
Your sign produces an individual that appeals to others, but one that
lives strictly by its own laws. There is a highly fixed blending of
the originality and independence of Aquarius with the emotional
intensity and will power of Scorpio. You command a lot of respect, but
more importantly, you have a healthy self-respect, as well. Your
personality is very strong, and you possess tremendous powers for good
or for constructiveness if you can only keep your emotional impulses
under mental control. You have a stubborn desire to get your own way,
and you're a highly determined leader. As a leader, you are one to
work right along with your subordinates since you never expect
anything from anyone that you yourself are not willing to do. You have
a good deal of ambition and enterprise, and these are well supported
by a dogged determination, making you very forceful when it comes to
getting things done. Some of your action may seem a bit impulsive and
ill-advised, but no one ever has to coax you to take an initial step
or make a decision. The intensity of your personality and the
determination to achieve keeps you constantly on the go. It's
important for you to learn to relax, for the restlessness of your
driving nature can have a damaging effect on your health if you don't
learn to unwind and perhaps communicate with nature a bit. It's also
good for you to learn not to take yourself so seriously, learn to
laugh at yourself, and refrain for being to rigid. Certainly, there is
nothing superficial in your nature, and there is little that you
cannot accomplish when you put your mind to it. Your persistence and
tenacity of purpose light your way to success.
