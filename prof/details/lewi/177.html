<h3>177</h3>
<p>
There is an unmistakably dreamy, inspired, and sensitive side to those born with
easy aspects between the Sun and Neptune. A marked appreciation for music and
the arts is present. The connection of Neptune with the Sun, which represents
the ego and the will, certainly softens some of the hard edges that might be
found elsewhere in the chart, adding a sensitive and spiritual dimension to the
personality. These people are naturally compassionate, especially those born
under the trine. It is so completely natural for them to accept that there is
more to the world than what is before their eyes, that they tend to presume
everyone must be spiritually-inclined. Of course, they come to realize that this
is not the case at some early point in their lives. Their attraction to
spirituality and metaphysical subjects is usually marked. These aspects favor
writers, artists, and musicians. These people are sensitive to those who are
suffering, although they are not as easily taken advantage of as those with
Sun-Moon challenging aspects. They are humanitarian and often have a special
connection with animals. If other aspects and positions in the chart support it,
these people are not ones to dominate others or assert themselves to the point
of brashness.
