<p>
Your sign shows that you can combine forcefulness and enough tact to
do pretty much as you please, and get away with it. For all the charm
and dash of manner about you, there is a distinct layer of steely
drive and determination. The aggressiveness and rough edges of Aries
are softened and smoothed by the influence of Taurus. You can be an
agreeable and polite person, with tactless behavior kept well in
check. You have a curious way of appearing tactful even as you lay
down the law and demand your way. There's a "sugar and spice" way of
driving your point home, and winning. You have a powerful magnetic
quality, coupled with a very strong will and determination for
leadership. All Aries are natural leaders, but in this configuration,
there is more stability and more of a solid base to the operation. You
think highly of yourself, though you aren't one to make a show of
this. Yet a pervading sense of your abilities is the foundation of
your life. You're never likely to suffer from an inferiority
complex. You need to learn to rule without dominating and to adjust
your desires to the happiness of those around you. Anyhow, regardless
of your sex, you're likely to be the dominate partner in your marital
relationship, and you'll try to control circumstances in nearly any
situation you find yourself.
