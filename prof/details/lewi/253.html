<h3>253</h3>
<p>
Power is important to you, but without further reflection, it will only remain
as something that is used for show or a bluff. You need to look inside yourself
to direct your energies toward positive goals and collect them to be more
decisive. Disappointments uncessarily kept inside can hinder even your utmost
heartfelt and good willed efforts, therefore you need to know yourself
better. Winning is important to you, but this can turn you into someone who
might justify any means for the needs. What you need to learn is the proper use
of power, this way you can reach success with your charm instead of your
trickery. Also, try to be supportive of causes as you (now) are usually
energetically against them.
