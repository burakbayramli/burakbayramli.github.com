<h3>113</h3>
<p>
You are an individual designed to be in charge. You have a vigorous
and vital personality capable of great popularity and of much success
in the world. You are a very self-sufficient person, and somewhat
aristocratic in your demeanor; a sort of aloofness and detachment that
makes you seem important even before you are. You possess a charisma
that allows you to work things out for your benefit without making a
big display or adamant demands. You know how to be assertive and
diplomatic at the right times and in the right manner. You may want
power and position, but you go about getting these in a quiet, cool
and collected way. You believe in yourself and know how to translate
your belief to others. You like to be the leader in any undertaking
because you usually feel that you are the one most qualified to run
the show. You are a very down-to-earth person, a materialist. The
abstract, the philosophic, or the visionary, hold little interest for
you. Emotionally, you are ardent although not exactly
warm-hearted. Emotions are not likely to ever interfere with duty and
responsibility.
