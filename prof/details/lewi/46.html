<h3>46</h3>
<p>
You have a good deal of ambition and determination in your
personality. Yet this is well disguised in a mask of congeniality and
understanding. The Cancer Sun is naturally understanding and
affectionate, lessening the normal coldness of the Capricorn
Moon. This lends good insight and a penetrating look at human
nature. You are well equipped for a role in some type of public or
official responsibility, and apt to gain recognition for your work in
this regard. Prestige and status are likely to flow your way if you
make any effort to achieve before the public. You have a reassuring
way as you always seem willing to assume responsibilities, and work
hard to reach goals. You expect things of value to require a good deal
of effort. Unassuming and unpretentious, you are ever willing to tow
your share of the load. You appreciate the value of a dollar, but
you're not likely to spare cost when it comes to obtaining quality for
your investment. A high degree of self-discipline allows you to save
or even hoard money for that rainy day. You have a shrewdness that
produces a genial and warm manner, but your purpose remains steely and
determined. This nice blend of the personal and the sincere, with the
calculating business core, allows you to accomplish much without
hurting anyone's feelings. It permits you to muster and retain many
friends along the way. You know how to drive a hard bargain with a
smile on your face, and you have a keen sense for understanding people
and instinctively sensing their motives.
