<h3>81</h3>
<p>
This sign in your chart forms a nature that is aspiring and
expansive. You are highly adventurous and apt to move about and seek a
variety of experiences. You are open and accepting of others, and to
you, people are people. No one is more openhearted and unbiased than
you. You have a positive spirit and the feeling that your ideals are
workable, and you hold to them until they are absolutely proven not to
be. This extends to very much to people as you believe that everyone
is essentially good, that good will triumph over evil, that dogs can
live with cats, and so on. You expect happy endings as you're an
incurable optimist. You are outgoing and eager to meet people, but
often you give them the sense that you haven't much time for
them. There is little that is stable or secure about you, and you seem
so much on the go that roots are never sunk deeply in anyone or even
in any social issue. You achieve success through charm and positive
efforts, but being abstract in your thinking, you become visionary and
impractical in business and personal affairs.
