<h3>4</h3>
<p>
Your sign blends the determined and aggressive traits of Aries, with
the sensitivity, sympathy, and intuition of Cancer. This pairing
produces a unique quality that generally permits you to succeed in a
variety of endeavors. Unlike many dynamic Aries types, you can "feel"
out the other fellow before jumping to an immediate conclusion. The
Cancer influence slows down a tendency merely to react with an
aggressive response to any stimuli. You are apt to put more thought
and understanding into your actions. You have a knack for handling
people because you know how to capture their imagination with your
flair for dramatic appeals, and your seeming concern for their general
welfare. This is not to say that you are a humanitarian by nature. In
fact, like all Aries, you are somewhat self-centered in many ways. But
talented enough, and sensitive enough, always to present yourself in a
very convincing light. Though it is unintentional, at times you are
damaging to others, or hurt them, without understanding that you are
doing so. Your social perceptions are so keen that you can rise very
rapidly with much popular support. The ease with which you can lead is
sometimes a wonder even to yourself. While you have much pride in your
abilities, you may often find yourself a little inwardly unsure. You
may question how you can gather the dash and excitement that permits
you to express yourself so convincingly. It's important that you
remember not to take yourself too seriously and avoid excesses in
dramatization.
