<h3>192</h3>
<p>
You possess excellent powers of concentration, and enjoy studying or deep
thinking in solitude. Discriminating and highly rational, you get right down to
the bare bones in any discussion, and are quick to see the fuzzy thinking or
weaknesses in another's logic. You are well suited to any work which requires
organized thinking, precision, and a methodical approach. You enjoy working on
problems that others consider too tedious, repetitive, or technical. You tend to
become a specialist in some field of knowledge, and to become engrossed in all
of the small details of that area, sometimes not realizing that few people share
your particular interest, especially to the extent that you do.
