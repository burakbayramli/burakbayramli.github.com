<h3>59</h3>
<p>
This combination is an interesting one, usually producing a very
attractive personality to most people. Your combination blends the
vitality, warmth, generosity, magnanimity, and pride of Leo, with the
originality, ingenuity and friendliness of Aquarius. Whatever you
undertake is usually met with popular support. You are highly social,
likable, and extroverted. There is a natural desire to project your
personality into public affairs or activities of a creative
nature. You are very philosophical and inclined to mental expansion
and creativity. You may not be as purposeful as you are idealistic and
romantic. On the many subjects that attract your interest, you are
sincere, but not deeply involved and committed. There is a tendency to
skim the surface and drift from one idea to the next, never getting
more than the most superficial understanding of anything. You don't
like to get too involved because your interests are so varied, and so,
you're reluctant to remain focused on one idea or one type of person
for long. This romanticism and idealism seems to out distance ambition
and commitment. You like knowing a little about many things and you
get along well in life with this gift.
