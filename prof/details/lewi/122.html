<h3>122</h3>
<p>
You have a personality that people find easy to like and admire. This
is not so much for what you do as it is for what you don't do. Your
never petty or small, and your appeal is to those in the higher as
well as the lower rungs of society. You don't pester people with your
worries and anxieties, but when others come to you, you drop
everything to listen to their problems. You're interested in people,
and like to be around them as an observer, but somehow maintaining a
distance and not getting too involved individually. You rate people
not on their position or rank, but simply on whether they interest you
or not. You have a certain self-sufficiency about you, and you never
feel that you have to put on airs to impress anyone. You have all it
takes to be executive, except the desire that would be required. You
seem to be devoid of any domineering or missionary spirit, willing to
"live and let live." This combination blends the originality and
independence of Aquarius, with the determination and powerful will of
Taurus. These two fixed signs together give a will that is so strong
that it may become obstinate and intransigent. Happiness can depend on
assuring peacefulness and harmony in environment or home life, and in
respect to human relationships. You need to be deeply interested in
people.
