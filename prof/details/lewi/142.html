<h3>142</h3>
<p>
You have a pleasant, sweet-tempered outlook most of the time. There is
a blending of emotional sensitivity and intuitive perception of
Pisces, with the conservatism, deep ambition and prudence of
Capricorn. The Pisces personality is naturally shy and sensitive;
Capricorn is a natural introvert. Yet when combined, Capricorn tends
to provide a degree of confidence, drive, and strength of purpose,
without being overly materialistic and shallow. Though you have your
feet planted solidly on the ground, your sensitivity and capacity for
sympathy enable you to avoid materialism. You want to get somewhere in
life, but without appearing pushy or too determined. Subtlety is your
style and method. Success comes from combining your inner intuitive
perceptiveness with outward practicality, responsibility and
integrity. You are practical, realistic, objective and
persevering. Organization is specialty, perhaps even your
fetish. There is a serious note in your nature making you keenly aware
of duties and responsibilities. Financial affairs may play an
important role in your life and progress can depend on sound handling
of financial affairs and avoiding the insecurities of
indebtedness. The personal qualities of prudence and caution increase
self-restraint and encourage control of the restless and emotional
tendencies of your nature. Your desires for prominence, social and
business distinction proves a powerful incentive in your field of
activity. You can achieve these goals after you have clearly
visualized what you desire to achieve, as your success depends on
concentrated effort. A good manager, you can easily see the big
picture and prefer dealing with the whole rather the detail of the
parts. You have a tendency to underrate yourself and worry much too
much.n
