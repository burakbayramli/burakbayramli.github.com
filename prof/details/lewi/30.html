<h3>30</h3>
<p>
Your sign suggests that you are dominated and motivated by
intellectual pursuits. The natural tendency of a Gemini Sun to have a
bright outlook and a versatile nature, is shaded by the Virgo
Moon. You may become carried away by trifles and petty worries. You
are moody and temperamental, with a good deal of self-dramatization
and a tendency to feel misunderstood and unappreciated. There is a
degree of tension and a nervous energy in your makeup that can be an
advantage or a disadvantage, depending on how it is used. You are very
alert, and always think things through, even if you don't always see
them through to completion. You may often jump from one project to
another with lightning speed. Digging deeply into any subject is not
your style. You can be critical of people, finding fault in their
reasoning, and you are never shy about telling it the way it is. You
are thought of as a "straight shooter" and your air of efficiency is
impressive. Though your expression may be pointed, it is never
vengeful in a heavy emotional way and you are never intentionally mean
or unreasonable. You are sociable and entertaining, with a desert-dry
sense of humor and wit. It may not seem so, but you are rather serious
and if you can force yourself to stick to a job, you can accomplish
much, especially if the project involves mental processes. Your mind
is sharp as a tack, and you have the logic and facts to back your
every move. Unfortunately, you may enjoy explaining your theories and
plans more than executing them. Developing the ability to relax and be
satisfied in the world as you find it will help you a great deal.
