<h3>130</h3>

<p>
You have a positive and authoritative personality; a very solid and
practical individual with individualistic qualities. The Aquarius side
of this nature brings originality and independence, but this is
tempered by the conservatism, deep ambition and caution of
Capricorn. Your calm persistence, deep determination and talent for
cold calculation or prudent thinking assure sound judgment and
realistic evaluation of conditions or situations. You know your course
in life and you are not one to be diverted by emotional
factors. Restless at times, you need to keep busy in your profession,
business or public life. You have a powerful sense of responsibility
and deep seriousness to your nature. Business responsibilities may be
heavy. You have great inner sources that enhance your
personality. This is a combination that shows the talent to cope with
large enterprises and for handling large numbers of people. You have
strong, deeply rooted convictions and ideals, and you conduct your
business with a strict code of ethics. You are a natural executive
with humanitarian leanings, as you combine friendliness and fair play
with your strict business principles. You strive more for power and
authority than for wealth and material success.n
