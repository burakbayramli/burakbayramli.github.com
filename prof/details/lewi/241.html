<h3>241</h3>
<p>
Your ambitions are almost in a deep sleep. You enjoy a good view of your own
powers by doing very little, but you aren't trying at all! Your almost mystical
belief in yourself preoccupies all your thoughts, you know what you can do if
you *really* wanted, but you must force yourself to want it. If there is energy
from other angles, this angle will increase your own confidence, but without
them, you are in trouble. If you do not set specific goals and work your will
power to move yourself toward them, this angle will take over and sap all your
momentum and forward energy.
