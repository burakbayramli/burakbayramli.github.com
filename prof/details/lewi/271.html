<h3>271</h3>
<p>
You might feel like the entire world's weight is on your tired shoulders. But
this pessimistic viewpoint of life tends to show you opportunuties as obstacles
which they are not, and also cause to exaggarate small uncomfort that life might
throw at you once in a while. This viewpoint will limit your capacity to realize
your dreams. Your unwillingness to accept responsibility for your actions will
impeed long lasting happiness and success. The "winning" attitude should be
seeing there are responsibilities that *everyone* needs to carry.

<br/><br/>

Also, you must learn to put your heart more into work while working with others.
