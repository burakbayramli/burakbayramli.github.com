<h3>123</h3>
<p>
Your Sun and Moon combined produces, quite surprisingly, a romantic
personality. Idealism is strong, mixed with some critical tendencies. A
romantic, but definitely living more by your mind that by your senses. You
dramatize life and yourself, often expanding and enhancing the facts of a
matter, idealizing love affairs and life in general. You rarely exclude much of
the fat from your stories. The Aquarius/Gemini mix yields a very harmonious and
versatile combination, blending the independence and originality of the
Aquarius, with the wit, versatility, and intellectuality of
Gemini. Intellectually you are quick, apt, and intuitive, but with a tendency to
skim only the surface of most subjects you encounter. In the real world
business, this can be a handicap. Your attention span is rather short. It's hard
to pin you down to reality, and you can easily find yourself drifting in
life. If this is not so in business, then it probably is in your personal
life. Having and holding a fixed purpose can be a problem. Actually, however,
your nature is truly much more fixed than it appears. Success depends on
emphasizing the decisive potential in your nature, and becoming involved in some
form of creative activity that allows you to express yourself mentally. You put
facts and ideas together so quickly that you are a natural for advertising,
writing, public speaking, or in just about any kind of job that allows you to
live by your wit. You tire easily of routine and detail. There is a duality in
your nature that shows rapid changes in moods and attitudes. You change your
mind often and abruptly. Companionship is extremely important to you. You need
someone to talk to constantly, and that someone must be mentally compatible and
stimulating to your intellectual growth and cultural achievement.
