<h3>57</h3>
<p>
You have a constant passion for travel, adventure, change, and
excitement. You are continuously looking for another mountain to climb
or stone to turn, and life seems a never ending chain of games to win
and adventures to explore. The combination here blends the Leo
vitality, authoritativeness, magnanimity and warmth, with Sagittarius
honesty, directness, versatility, and sincerity, yielding a very
optimistic and enthusiastic temperament. Yours is a restless, but
always positive and alert mind. Your challenge is to keep the white
hot flames of this dual Fire sign ablaze, and avoid the tendencies for
energies to go up in smoke and be wasted with lively, but unproductive
activities. You are more subject to burn out than most. By harnessing
your fiery emotional nature to constructive purposes and setting goals
for yourself, there is little that you cannot do. You charm people
with your dash and enthusiasm. Your boundless energy and imaginative
equipment assures you have the abilities to go far if you can only
channel your efforts and remain true to your goals. It's hard for you
to settle down to a job, to a relationship, to a solid base of
operation, or to a truly focused purpose of any kind. Pettiness and
triteness infuriate you, and subtlety is not your style. You may get
into trouble by saying exactly what you feel, never mincing words or
sparing feelings. While you remain mobile and independent you are
happy, but when you begin to feel confined and harnessed, you can
become very unhappy and dispirited.
