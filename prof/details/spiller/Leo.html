    The Achilles Heel of such people is their overdeveloped need to fit in and
    be accepted by their peers. This person must be their own best friend and
    push themselves to seek things that will bring them happiness. They also
    need to stay away from the trap of constantly looking for more
    knowledge. They will never find enough of it to the degree that will force
    them into action anyway; so instead they need to take charge and move
    forward in a direction that will bring them their own personal happiness.
