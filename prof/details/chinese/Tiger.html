<h3>Tiger</h3>
<p>
Tigers may not be the king of the jungle, but these striped cats are no softies! 
Magnetic and self-possessed, Tigers are born leaders. They have an air of 
authority that prompts others to fall in line, which is exactly how they like 
it. Although they are magnetically charming and fun to be around, Tigers like to 
go it alone sometimes too. A Tiger's main interest is in following its ambitions 
-- and maintaining control. 

<br/><br/>
 
Tigers are courageous beyond compare and generally come out ahead in battle, be 
it in the boardroom or the bedroom. Seduction is one area where the Tiger is 
definitely king! Noble and warm-hearted, Tigers have a natural, raw appeal 
that's extremely attractive to other Signs. They're not just about attraction, 
though; ever on the side of right, Tigers will fight the good fight to the 
bitter end if the cause is worthy. Opponents are wise to fear this feline. 

<br/><br/>
 
A bit of caution is a good thing around Tigers, since they can pounce without 
warning. They experience mood swings and often feel things more intensely than 
others, the latter quality being both good and bad. They can react poorly under 
stress and are prone to emotional outbursts. This Sign's bristling sensitivity 
can send friend and foe running for cover. 

<br/><br/>
 
A lesson that Tigers would be well-served to learn is "moderation in all 
things." Once these cats can find their center and direct their considerable 
energies toward worthwhile endeavors (as opposed to racing through life), they 
will accomplish much. 

<br/><br/>
 
The most compatible match for a Tiger is the Horse or the Dog.
