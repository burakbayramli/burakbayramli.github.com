<h3>Rat</h3>
<p>
Though the Western rat is reviled as little more than a bottom-dwelling disease 
carrier, this animal is viewed much differently in the East. The Eastern rat is 
revered for its quick wits and its ability to accrue and hold on to items of 
value; rats are considered a symbol of good luck and wealth in both China and 
Japan. Clever and quick-witted, the Rat of the Chinese Zodiac is utterly 
disarming to boot. Possessed of excellent taste, this Sign flaunts its style at 
every turn. Its natural charm and sharp, funny demeanor make it an appealing 
friend for almost anyone. The Rat likes to know who is on its side and will 
treat its most loyal friends with an extra measure of protection and generosity. 

<br/><br/>
 
Behind that sweet smile, though, Rats are keen and unapologetic promoters of 
their own agendas. This Sign is motivated by its own interests, which often 
include money; greed can become a problem if the Rat isn't careful to keep its 
priorities straight. This Sign's natural powers of charm and persuasion can 
definitely come in handy! Although they are often hoarders, Rats can be very 
generous to those in their "pack," namely friends and family members who have 
proven their loyalty. Others might perceive them as quick-tempered and 
sharp-tongued, but never boorish. Verbal jousting is a great pleasure for the 
Rat, a Sign that everyone around will quickly learn either to love or to hate. 

<br/><br/>
 
Rats enjoy being on the outside looking in, as the outside affords a view into 
the inner workings of a system or situation. The Rat's keen mind always seeks 
out new knowledge, to be stored away for future use. This ever-curious Sign also 
welcomes challenges as a way to stay sharp. If boredom sets in the Rat is no fun 
at all, but that isn't likely; this Sign knows how to keep itself entertained. 

<br/><br/>
 
A valuable lesson for Rats is to learn to consider others above themselves, at 
least sometimes. If they can develop their sense of self and realize it leaves 
room for others in their life as well, Rats could find true happiness. 

<br/><br/>
 
The most compatible match for a Rat is the Dragon or the Monkey.
