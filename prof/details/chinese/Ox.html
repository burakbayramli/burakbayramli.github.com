<h3>Ox</h3>
<p>
The Ox of Chinese Astrology is no bull in a china shop. Steadfast and solid, 
this powerful Sign is a born leader, being quite dependable and possessing an 
innate ability to achieve great things. Oxen tend to be plodding and methodical; 
they approach projects in the step-by-step manner that serves them best, and 
they never lose sight of their goal. They are tireless workers who are 
detail-oriented and believe in doing things right the first time. 

<br/><br/>
 
The world may perceive Oxen as being far too serious or incapable of loosening 
up. This sturdy sort is less than social by nature and tends to become 
introverted in a crowd. To make things worse, they can't be bothered with what 
other people think and prefer to do what makes them feel best. Behind that calm 
facade, though, lives an Ox who can feel hurt, lonely and unable to connect with 
others. Friends and family are a great source of comfort to this beast, even if 
they don't always understand what makes the Ox tick. As a lover, friend, family 
member or housemate, the Ox makes a wonderfully strong, tender and affectionate 
companion who is protective and always reliable. 

<br/><br/>
 
Out in the world, though, Oxen tend to be stubborn, dogmatic, 
my-way-or-the-highway kind of people who have no concept of when to back 
down. Oxen don't care to be pushed, especially since they think they're the good 
guys of the Chinese Zodiac. There is some truth to that theory, since the Ox is 
smart, trustworthy, caring and honorable. If you need honest, steady and 
unbiased advice, call on the Ox. 

<br/><br/>
 
A good lesson for mighty Oxen is to strive to overcome a judgmental nature that 
keeps them from getting close to others. If they can learn to value their own 
good qualities, they'll have more room in their hearts to invite others in. 

<br/><br/>
 
The most compatible match for an Ox is the Snake or the Rooster.
