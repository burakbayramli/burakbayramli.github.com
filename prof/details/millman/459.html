<h3>45/9</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals provide an inspiring example of how to follow a careful,
disciplined process to reach goals and achieve a sense of inner freedom. Strong,
witty, and charismatic, they attract many friends, admirers, and students;
whether or not they call themselves teachers, they teach by example,
demonstrating true wisdom and inner freedom. Bound by no conventional rules but
aligned with higher laws, their life may appear ordinary from the outside, but
their influence, even in the midst of ordinary activities, has an extraordinary
quality that inspires others around them.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals display strength and cleverness, but they don't know what to
do with either. Scattered, undisciplined, disoriented, and sometimes overwhelmed
by a sense that they are missing something important, they hide behind the roles
they play, seeking security there. They don't live what they profess, deceiving
themselves as well as others. Ungrounded and irresponsible, they may feel "free"
and "liberated," but they never really challenge or test their own
views. Because of this, they face hard lessons about reality.
