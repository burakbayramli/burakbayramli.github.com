<h3>15/6</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
Inspired and uplifting, these individuals reveal visions of new possibilities
and a brighter future. As high-minded strategists, through focus and discipline
they apply their active creative energies to awakening people from the mundane
into the more sublime, more peaceful, liberated beings that they really are. At
their best, these creative visionaries embody and channel the very force of
human evolution to help change their world and themselves. Accepting themselves
and others, they work with patience to convey positive laws of living through
their work. They show the way to perfect freedom.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Picky, judgmental, and disappointed with life, these individuals search high and
low for the right person, idea, system, or scheme to make life better and to
make themselves better, but their search only reinforces their sense of
incompleteness. They are unrealistic dreamers and unprepared idealists who often
become martyrs to a cause. Frustrated with themselves and others, they misdirect
their stifled creative energy, discharging it in self-destructive ways. They use
drugs or other means to tune out a world that falls painfully short of truth,
justice, honor, or peace.
