<h3>27/9</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals exude depth and charisma based on their heartfelt trust in
Spirit working through them. With their balanced, compassionate wisdom, they
have also learned to trust Spirit in the form of other people and in the form of
life's circumstances, which, no matter how pleasurable or difficult, they
experience as teachings. Although their needs are often met, even in adversity
they feel thankful for the lessons they receive. They make natural leaders who
teach by example. Committed to service and expressing universal wisdom rather
than rigid opinions, they help inspire others through their integrity and their
attunement to higher laws. They are natural leaders who teach by
example. Maintaining a feeling connection to the higher will within them, they
effectively serve others.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Deluded preachers or eternal seekers, these individuals center their world
around a particular teaching, method, religion, or philosophy. Quiet fanatics,
they live according to the dictates or opinions of others and act as if their
own opinions were sacred. Others who don't trust themselves may follow or admire
such individuals, mistaking strong opinions for spiritual authority. Deep down,
these 27/9s feel lonely and cut off from the world and from true inspiration in
their lives, because they trust their mind over their heart. They fear and
eventually attract betrayal by others, even by their own body.
