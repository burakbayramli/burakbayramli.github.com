<h3>25/7</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
The life of these individuals may or may not appear spiritual or include
spiritual practices or inner work. But no matter what field they engage in,
these 25/7s are a source of often deep understanding because they look inside to
find whatever they need to know. They also learn from others, but they respect
their own internal feelings and messages. They are adventurers who bring to
light the freedom within; living the liberated life, feeling comfortable and at
home almost anywhere, they find satisfaction sharing the truths that experience
has taught them. Embodying inner freedom, touched by a sense of oneness, peace,
and inner harmony, they go out and touch others. They are grateful for all
experiences, because these 25/7s see Spirit everywhere.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Preferring solitude, these isolated individuals avoid people because they don't
feel others can be trusted. Aimless seekers of experience, avid readers, or
spiritual tramps, they constantly look for the book, training, or teacher who
can help them be whole or give them the conclusive understanding they want with
their mind. Nevertheless, they don't find what they are seeking, because they
are searching outside themselves. They're among the paranoids of the world; they
assume they're going to be left out, and to the degree they act like a recluse,
they do get left out.
