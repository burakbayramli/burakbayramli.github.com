<h3>16/7</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals share their high vision and reveal new possibilities through
their creative endeavors as they express truth and beauty. Their intense eyes
and sparkling energy and their crisp, refined qualities reveal them as
high-minded "angels" in human form. Having found unconditional, but not naive,
trust in themselves and others, they see the inherent perfection and larger
workings of a loving Spirit even in the most difficult circumstances. Inspired
by a higher purpose, they find deep meaning in uplifting and moving others to a
more refined, elevated sense of their own lives.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Feeling bitter and betrayed, insecure and self-destructive, these individuals
can have a hard time being here. They feel disappointed in themselves and in
others and frustrated that no one has lived up to their expectations, which are
now abandoned or turned sour. They long for a more ideal world, but feeling
unable to contribute, they have given up hope. Isolated as hermits, they fear
others' criticism, and so withdraw from social contacts. Feeling misunderstood
and judged by others, they find escape in drugs or in illusory fantasy realms.
