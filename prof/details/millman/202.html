<h3>20/2</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals balance strength and flexibility, home and work, time for
others and time for self. Their bodies stay relaxed and supple, reflecting their
internal equanimity, because they worry less and intuit more. Consummate problem
solvers and mediators in family or business, they help others to reach
agreement, just as they have reached internal harmony and integration within
themselves. Using both their strength and sensitivity in support of others, they
feel useful and appreciated; they support and appreciate themselves, as well,
honoring their boundaries, feelings, and limits.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
No one ever knows what these individuals want, not even themselves; they're too
preoccupied doing what they think they are supposed to do, and they are quick to
expect that others should do the same. Chronically codependent, they feel
responsible for almost everything, keeping the moon and stars in place while
meeting everyone's needs. Other people's whims become their demands. They
"sacrifice for others" and then resent it; they tend to give too much, then
resist or withdraw completely. Physically, mentally, and emotionally stressed
from worrying about everyone else, they suffer from allergies and other
ailments.
