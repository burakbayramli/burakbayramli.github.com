<h3>28/10</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals serve as authority figures whom others admire and
respect. They serve as intuitive advisers to friends, loved ones, and
others. Having overcome insecurity, such 28/10s make good money in service of
others, feeling the healing force that flows through them. Independent,
self-sufficient, even enchanting, they attract others to their energy
field. They know that whatever difficulties or challenges arise, they have the
power to deal with them. Intuitive and inspiring, they provide clear counsel for
the highest good of all concerned.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Insecure, trapped in negative beliefs about money and authority, feeling needy
and dependent, these individuals control and manipulate others. They resent
authority figures because they haven't yet taken on their own
authority. Suffering physically with symptoms of repressed anger and
frustration, they fear the dark images that appear in their imagination; they
are unable to discriminate between negative impressions and clear
intuitions. Such 28/10s haven't yet experienced or contacted the inner and outer
guides available to them.
