<h3>33/6</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
Surrounded by a bright energy field reflecting purity and clarity, these
sensitive individuals have an attractive energy and enthusiastic way of helping
others to see their own perfection and the positive side of every issue. Their
body is strong because they've developed and refined it through proper exercise
and diet. They accept their shape whether or not it meets anyone else's idea of
perfection. They see the inherent perfection of others, and they have come to
accept themselves; self-evaluation has changed to self-valuation. They always
have a kind word or good thing to say about others. Their laser eyesight can
spot the beauty in anyone or anything; they see the higher beings we are all
becoming. With their high standards and sense of fairness, they work for
justice, right, and truth in constructive ways.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Tight-lipped, inhibited outsiders, these individuals have down-turned corners of
their mouth that indicate their disappointment with most people and their anger
and frustration about the world. "It isn't fair!" is the battle cry of these
harsh critics, as they judge the world against unreachable ideals. They hold in
their expression or let it out in negative tirades and complaints as their laser
vision points out the flaws in everyone and everything. Their body holds tension
within extra fat or extra muscle as body armor to insulate them from a world
that feels burdensome due to their own self-imposed standards.
