<h3>Sheep</h3>
<p> 
Daydreaming all afternoon sounds heavenly to the Sheep. This creative, esoteric 
Sign needs plenty of time alone in which to feed its Muse. Sheep are generally 
most comfortable in their own minds (which other, more linear-thinking Signs may 
have trouble deciphering). This Sign makes a great craftsperson or artisan, or 
perhaps a teacher of New Age studies -- any occupation that allows its mind the 
full range of freedom. Sheep tend not to be very well-organized, precluding many 
more dry business endeavors. In fact, Sheep tend not to be very materialistic in 
general, finding plenty of riches in their own imagination. However, especially 
when in love, the Sheep can be quite a lavish gift-giver. 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
Perhaps it's that artistic temperament that so often causes Sheep to feel 
insecure, but the result is that these high-strung creatures need to feel loved 
and admired lest they start worrying incessantly. For this reason, Sheep tend to 
have a hard time with romance; anyone who couples up with a Sheep must know, 
this Sign has a sensitive streak a mile wide and can be subject to bouts of 
anxiety over seemingly inconsequential things. Sheep need plenty of love, 
support and open reassurance from their lovers. If a relationship is marked by 
conflict, the Sheep will often pull away -- either physically or simply by 
retreating into the safe haven of its imagination. 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
If the romance is going well, however, Sheep won't hesitate to tell their 
partner what they need -- and they can be quite insistent about it! This Sign 
will definitely return the favor, however; the Sheep has a luxurious side that 
delights in indulging a lover's every wish. Appearances are also important to 
the Sheep, which may explain why these folks can spend hours primping and 
posing. 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
Sheep would be well-served by learning to relax and let others run the show from 
time to time. Once they can be certain that their friends and lovers won't be 
gone when the Sheep returns from its daydreams, life will be a field of daisies. 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
The most compatible match for a Sheep is the Pig or the Rabbit.
