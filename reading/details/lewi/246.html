<h3>246</h3>
<p>
The emotions and the will are at peace with one another, suggesting a rather
balanced personality. The "messages" received in childhood were not
contradictory overall, and these people have a stronger sense of purpose and
appreciation of harmony than most people. Many people with these aspects are
personally popular, likely because they expect harmony in their
relationships. Sun sextile or trine Moon people are generally very attracted to
relationships and are attractive to the opposite sex. A certain level of
self-confidence and a sense of security make these people quite easy to deal
with on many levels. Their relaxed, easygoing disposition puts others at ease.

<br/><br/>

When the Sun and Moon are in harmonious aspect, the natives may not be prepared
for conflict and could be inclined to avoid rocking the boat. They may acquiesce
a little too often, if only to maintain a feeling of balance and harmony, as
conflict is something they not only dislike, it's something they might fear. The
tendency towards too much acceptance--of the self and of others--is most
prominent with the trine. These people must be encouraged to question life, or
they run the risk of taking things for granted.

<br/><br/>

Vitality is usually good and quite constant. These are not hard-driving people,
unless other indications in the chart point to it, but the constitution is
generally strong. At any rate, they are not prone to the kinds of ups and downs
that plague those with challenging aspects between the Sun and Moon. This is
because their goals and their emotional needs are in harmony, despite being
different.

<br/><br/>

When the Sun and Moon are sextile or trine, the native is unmistakably
accepting, although rather strong-willed as well. There can be a tendency for
the native to expect to get what he or she wants, simply because the desire
nature is at peace within him- or herself. Complacency is a possibility and
often a complaint of the native's partners. However, the ease with which this
native deals with others can certainly be an asset. People with these aspects
who don't go the complacent route are very much primed and ready for
relationships.
