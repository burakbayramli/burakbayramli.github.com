<h3>28</h3>
<p>
Your sign is beneficial to both, but often produces a somewhat
high-strung emotional nature. Life is full of stimuli and
fascinations, and the mind is always searching for experiences,
romances, and revolutionary ideas to explore. You possess unusual
emotional depth for a Gemini, and what your quick intellect doesn't
pick up on, your emotions do. You have a greater ability to
concentrate than others of your Sun sign. Keeping your mind focused is
the key to controlling an ever present problem with nervous
tension. If you can concentrate on some study or pursuit, putting your
mind on it and leaving it there, problems with nerves seem to
disappear. But when you dwell on personal issues and petty problems,
you may find yourself becoming progressively more subject to
tensions. You have a great need for peace, quiet, and stability in
your life, and it is important that you establish these early in
life. Unfortunately, domestic stability doesn't come easily or
naturally for you, but it is important all the same. For all your
problems with thinking and emotions, you always come out well. You are
sure of yourself and confident of your analyses. You know what is
going on in the minds of men, and you have little difficult predicting
their actions. Tricks and games people play seem crystal clear to you,
and you have an intuitive sense of how to react.
