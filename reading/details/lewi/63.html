<h3>63</h3>
<p>
Your sign makes mind power your greatest strength. Quick, brilliant
reasoning is the hallmark of this configuration. You are rational,
capable of figuring things out analytically, and of grasping details
and intricacies. Because you are so inclined to live by reason, the
emotional side of your nature is not nearly so responsive. It isn't
that you're not sympathetic or emotional, but cold logic sometimes
gives that appearance. You can detect underlying motives and feeling
with ease, thanks to your careful perceptions. Your responses to what
you have perceived may not be particularly emotional or sympathetic,
as it is difficult for you to mix or integrate your logic and your
feeling. You are a natural student with a thirst for knowledge, and
you do almost equally well with definite, detailed work and abstract,
philosophical thought. In a sense you may appear fickle and too
changeable because of the variety of mental interests that appeal to
you. Physically, you may have a tendency to "go to pot" if you don't
make a special effort to keep in shape. You'll never be fat as nervous
energy burns the necessary calories, but your muscle tone may
deteriorate, and you may grow pale and wan from lack of exercise. In
your youth, active sports were important to you, but as you mature
there is too much of a tendency to become sedentary. You're inclined
to take to a good book or to any number of hobbies that are passive in
nature. Exercise is the best medicine for the enormous amounts of
nervous energy associated with this configuration.
