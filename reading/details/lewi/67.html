<h3>67</h3>
<p>
You have a personality that is discriminating, intellectual, and
peace-loving. This position blends the intelligence, analytical
insight and discrimination of Virgo, with the emotional balance,
courtesy and friendliness of Libra. You are friendly and know how to
make a good impression, but you can remain detached and impersonal in
relationships. You have a sense of restraint and diplomacy in your
nature that prevents you from ever coming on very strong. You may not
even voice your opinion unless you feel you really have something of
value to offer. Mental stimulation and study keep your quiet and
observant personality occupied and content. You enjoy companionship
and in having a good time, but excesses and extremes are not your
style. The critical aspect of Virgo is softened by the Libra Moon,
creating a fine and precise balance. The elements of discrimination
and criticism blend to make you very selective in associations, and
contained or restrained in the saying or doing of anything that might
hurt or offend others. Your reaction to coarseness is avoidance. While
perhaps a lover of humanity in general, your tendency to examine
individuals closely before you accept them in any social sense, leads
others to view you as highly aloof and particular. You have a way of
eluding the issue and being thought of hard to get to know. You
practice a quiet and unassuming approach to life, having a live and
let live creed. The social aspects of Libra make you inclined to enjoy
friendships, but not the deep, intimate relationships associated with
romance. You have an intellectual curiosity and love to experiment, to
muse over what you have learned. Mental analysis and impartial
judgment are the major strengths of this combination.
