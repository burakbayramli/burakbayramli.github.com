<h3>193</h3>
<p>
You always have original and brilliant ideas. Your creative and talented mind
will be constantly active demonstrating its genius and quickness in
understanding ideas that others cannot. You are very eloquent and a bit dramatic
in expressing yourself. Also, you are very intuitive, which leads you to
comprehend things more deeply. You are interested in everything new, original,
and progressive. 

<br/><br/>

Independent and free-thinking, you dislike being told what to do and
how to do it, and you especially do not like being told how to think,
for you insist on discovering your own truth. You do well in a rather
unstructured environment that allows you to make your own decisions
and to respond to the needs of the moment, rather than following a
routine, standardized way of doing things. You are also suited to a
fast-paced atmosphere, which you find exciting and stimulating. Your
mind functions in an intuitive, nonlinear fashion and sudden insights
and flashes of inspiration often come to you "out of the blue". You
have an aptitude for science and new technologies especially interest
you. You also have a penchant for astrology or other esoteric
sciences.
