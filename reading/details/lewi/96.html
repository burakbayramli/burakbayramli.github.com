<h3>96</h3>
<p>
Your sign produces a person with terrific intuition and sense that
ordinary people simply don't have. You are overly dramatic and
frequently exaggerate problems. You are, likewise, able to capture the
drama of your surroundings as well as the imagination of the
public. Yours is an emotional profundity that lends a great deal of
inspiration to your personality. You attack any problem with
unswerving enthusiasm and devotion, always giving more that just a
part of yourself to your causes or ideals. Here there is a blend of
the emotional force, determination and will power of Scorpio with the
sensitivity, impressionability and intuitive insight of Pisces. This
produces a strongly emotional and somewhat psychic or receptive and
impressionable nature. A studious and intellectual bend permits you to
succeed, especially in literary or artistic endeavors. You are very
creative, but your success may be more from a willingness to apply
yourself than from pure talent. On the down side, you are anxious and
worry too much. Positive thinking is essential for you to attain
personal balance and peace of mind. There are unexpected depths in
your nature and you succeed by concentrating your energies on definite
objectives, avoiding the tendency to dispense emotional energies and
intellectual power in overemphasis on romance, daydreaming or negative
apprehensions or worries.
