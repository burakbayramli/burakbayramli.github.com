<h3>39</h3>
<p>
Your sign produces a highly sensitive and intuitive
personality. Flexibility and adaptability are your strengths and
sometimes your weakness, as well. You are tuned in to your world and
always eager to please. You are essentially a warm and feeling person,
and little escapes your impressionable mind. You are a trusting sort,
but after too many disappointments and discouraging experiences, you
have a tendency to withdraw into yourself. You enjoy social events and
really hate feeling that you have been left out of any group. You have
a strong curiosity, and don't mind experimenting. Yet if things don't
turn out well on your first effort, you are quick to give up and go
back to tried ways. Sticking with an endeavor is not one of your
strong points. Your feelings are easily hurt, and until you learn not
to let it happen, you'll find yourself in a fuming turmoil most of the
time. You're highly flexible and adaptable, but indecision may be a
lifelong problem. Even if you don't let it show, internally, you're
never very sure of yourself.
