<h3>120</h3>
<p>
Your sign is harmonious and interesting. You have a receptive
temperament and you're strongly influenced by outside impressions and
environment. You mix a very practical, serious and ambitious side,
with a somewhat restless and variable personality. It may be hard,
sometimes, for you to exhibit the firmness and steady purpose so often
attributed to Capricorn. Often this is overshadowed by a sentimental
and sympathetic touch to your nature. You have an intuitive insight
that makes you very aware of the feelings of others. You have a rather
serious and penetrating interest in life, and to you, most issues seem
to have depth and complexity. Honest and trustworthy, you would never
resort to trickery or deceit. You are thorough in your work and eager
to know all you can about a variety of things. Your nature is very
humanitarian and you are likely to be much less materialistic than
many fellow Capricorn natives. In personal relationships, you need to
exercise discrimination, overcoming a somewhat passive tendency that
makes you susceptible to the influences of others.
