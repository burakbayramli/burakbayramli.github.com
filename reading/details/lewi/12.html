<h3>12</h3>
<p>
You are a somewhat introverted, self-analyzing, soul-searcher; not at
all the typical Aries. Though you may have great potential in many
directions, you seem to always harbor doubts and underestimate
yourself. Making everyday decisions can, at times, be a trying
experience for you. Strangely, however, you have a very determined
streak in your nature, a need to be independent. You take things very
personally, and impressions that come to you via your senses leave a
very indelible mark on your mind. It's hard for you to avoid being
very moody and worrying entirely too much. Your natural demeanor
denies this, as you give a great impression of forcefulness, but
internally you are timid, a little afraid of the world, and even
afraid and unsure of your opinions. Again, you don't let the world see
the shy person that you are. You dislike being imposed upon and you
aren't shy about letting others know this. You express yourself
readily with a facile manner of speaking. Bold as a lion on the
outside, but meek as a lamb underneath. You have some difficulty
concentrating, simply because you're a little too much the
dreamer. You're not a very executive person and you aren't well suited
for business; decisions are just too hard to make. It may be best not
to worry about such matters, and instead concentrate on more congenial
endeavors such as art, music, or writing, any of which would appeal
more to your creative nature.
