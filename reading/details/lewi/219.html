<h3>219</h3>
<p>
This angle points to monetary wealth either through your own efforts or through
inheritance. Especially along with 147 or 148 for men, 168, 169 or 174 for
women, it will point to a "marriage" that will bring wealth.

<br/><br/>

Very dangerous undertakings will bring more wealth and security. This is not an
angle of stinginess and nest building, because your moves in material world will
be broad strokes. You are a kind of a gambler, you could risk all you have for a
simple heads and tails game. But the funny thing is, you are lucky enough to
justify this willingness! Your business sense is strong as well. Your material
being is sound and you can add even more to this foundation as days pass
by. Congradulations!
