<h3>72</h3>
<p>
You have insights, an understanding mind, a profound personality. You
are both intellectual and intuitive, can reason things out by cold
logic, learn facts, and absorb figures, while your hunches are
actively at work. Born wise, you know a lot without being told. The
combination blends the intelligence, analytical insight and
discrimination of Virgo with the emotional sensitivity and intuitive
understanding of Pisces. Born during a full Moon, you express a
profundity of mind, studious inclination, and deep understanding that
sets you apart from most people. Success in business or a profession
is aided by a keen intellect and sound retentive memory. However, the
strong blending of the intellectual and the intuitive may steer you
toward more contemplative inclination of mind and away from the
practical. Perhaps you are interested in the arts, music, or the
metaphysical. You can easily balance practical interests and the
theoretical. The vast differences in your individuality and your
conditioned responses can cause a good deal of restlessness in your
nature. Thought and feeling, logic and intuition, observation and
impression, all are balanced well in this
configuration. Understanding, but critical, you are highly respected
for your ability to listen and advise with trustworthy
discretion. While not being very ambitious and perhaps not the best
executive, you are willing to shoulder a good deal of
responsibility. You really don't want to be in the spotlight, yet you
are very popular and people seem to just naturally rely on you.
