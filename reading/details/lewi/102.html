<h3>102</h3>
<p>
You have a good deal of intellectual power, and with it, the ability
to bring generalizations down to details and specific plans. This
position blends the personal dash, optimism, enthusiasm and directness
of manner of Sagittarius, with the intelligence, analytical insight
and discrimination of Virgo. Consequently, this combination produces a
lot of achievers and outstanding people. You have an excellent mind,
capable of handling broad concepts and minute details with equal
ability. Your well-developed mental powers permit you to move from
broad concepts down to technical details assuring versatility and
adaptability in business or in a profession. Realism tinged with a
critical analysis, romanticism without being too impractical, these
are your gifts. You see clearly without the help of rose-colored
glasses, and you relate what you see and know with honesty and and a
well-defined authority. No one has to guess where you stand on any
issue. Thinkers that dwell on issues that are philosophically
practical are always in demand. You can be pushy, but not to the
extent that you offend. Rather, your manner can be described as
diplomatic and charming, but still there is the authority of a
director or tutor. It's sometimes necessary to guard against a
tendency to be somewhat impulsive. You are at your best when you don't
rush things or allow yourself to be pressured.
