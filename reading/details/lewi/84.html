<h3>84</h3>
<p>
You have a personality with much breadth and scope. In your quiet,
pensive way, you are always watching, staring, observing, and mulling
over in your mind what you have seen. You are extremely sensitive, and
there is much more to you than ever really meets the eye. Pisces is
highly receptive and deep. You are quite timid for social Libra, and
most will consider you one who stands off and is aloof or distant. As
suggested, the Libra influence pulls against this tendency because it
is the most sociable of signs. These contradictory pulls in your
nature make you very difficult for others to understand. Reserve and
shyness seem your main strengths. You are not a social hermit only
because a core of strength within you that urges you to become
involved in life instead of sitting on the sidelines. In group
situations, unlike many Libra types, you don't overwhelm others with
your polite charm and outgoing personality. Instead you express a
quiet, reserved manner that seems to take no effort on your part no
matter how much activity is going on around you. You have a genuine
concern for others and you can convey this to them. You are a superb
listener. You are an idea person, but not necessarily an idealist. You
get along with moderate effort, relying on your good sense. Perhaps a
sixth sense helps you in many of your endeavors as you can grasp
abstractions and intricacies, both mentally and emotionally. You are
good at guesses and always a good detective.
