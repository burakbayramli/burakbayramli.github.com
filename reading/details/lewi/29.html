<h3>29</h3>
<p>
Your sign places you in a class of true "personality people." Your
interests are so varied, your tastes so inclusive, your attitudes so
tolerant, that you have a very broad appeal to many different people
with whom you come in contact. An apparently happy-go-lucky nature
conceals a core of sound good sense, just as the apparent fickle in
your nature hides deep-seated loyalty and fidelity. You may be
changeable in many ways, but when you settle to person or a course of
action, you stay settled. Your mind turns from one subject to the
next, from one relationship to another, but sooner or later the
wavering and fluctuating stops, and you establish yourself. People
have difficulty understanding you, not so much because you are
complex, but merely because you are so hard to pin down. When your
mind is made up to go after something, however, you don't
hesitate. Your warmth and amiability make you the life of many
parties. You are confident of the impression you make on people and
you are a study of joviality and good nature. You can get along very
well in life with your kind of personality. Even when people don't
agree with what you say, they admire the way you say it. Oddly, a
somewhat brooding spirit can invade your personality when things
(especially romances) don't come together as you feel they
should. Nonetheless, you are blessed with a good personality, a good
level head, and more than your fair share of good luck.
