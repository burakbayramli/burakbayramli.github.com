refined intuitive insight. You can "feel" the truth about people and
conditions. While highly sensitive and somewhat introspective, you can

waste time trying to peddle things that people aren't buying. You have
a knack for making money and the conservative instincts to hang on to
it. You can be rather secretive at times, keeping things to yourself
until you are ready to take others into your confidence. At times you
feel the need to withdraw somewhat into yourself, establishing poise
and balance in enjoying moments of quiet peace and
introspection. Generally, you need to cultivate demonstrative or
extroverted tendencies of personality by countering excessive
introspection. There is a very strong domestic side to your nature; a
deep interest in home and family. You need the support of these close

power and a tenacity of purpose. Be willing to to trust your intuitive
impressions or feelings about things to guide you in the right
