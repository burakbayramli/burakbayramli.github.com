<h3>136</h3>
<p>
You have a personality that is deep in feelings and very complex. You
are sensitive and alert to the opinions and the feelings of the world
around you, and with sort of a sixth sense, you can give the public
what it wants almost before it knows that it wants it. Whatever you
decide to do, you go about it with the greatest seriousness and
intensity. You tackle any job with vigor, discipline, and drive. Your
personality is very controlled and self-assured. The forcefulness in
your nature was put there by self-discipline, as you were originally a
rather shy person who had to make yourself get out into the public
eye. You know how to handle people and win them over to your way of
thinking because you understand them so well. You know when to concede
and when to stand your ground. When your instincts don't put you on
guard, you make friends very quickly and easily because people can
sense your sincerity. Your insights to people let you relax with those
you know are genuine and real. While you really have a very kindly and
adaptable nature, it may not seem so because you are so emphatic and
dramatic in your every gesture, motion, and word. You have an
extremely high regard for your own self-worth so that nothing can ever
make you loose faith in yourself. Moods play an important role in your
daily affairs and you can reflect some rather broad swings. You gain
much from your ability to know when to do what.
