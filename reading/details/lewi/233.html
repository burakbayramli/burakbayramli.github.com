<h3>233</h3>
<p>
You suffer because you remember your failures more than your successes and
consequently have a hard time developing a picture of yourself as a winner. In
this sense you were born old. However, this same quality engenders a childish
quality in you that tends to look for the "quick fix". Hard work and consistency
of effort brings success for you just like it does for everyone else. Yes, you
need some luck or some breaks, but these come from perspective, vision or aim in
life. Work to see yourself as deserving good things in life, then be willing to
put forth honest effort. 

<br/><br/>

Jupiter square Saturn: *You have an inner conflict between idealism, hope, and
faith in the future versus doubt and oppression by limitations and practical
realities. You need to develop discipline and patience in order to achieve your
aspirations. You will grow by learning to accept frustration and to persevere in
spite of obstacles.

<br/><br/>

Jupiter opposition Saturn: *You tend to seesaw between hope, optimism, and faith
versus doubt and oppression by limitations and practical realities. You need to
overcome impatience and restlessness in order to achieve your dreams and desires
for a better life.

<br/><br/>

In all your business and personal dealings you have the capacity for
patience. You keep one eye on the goal and the other on the moment-to-moment
activities that lead you forward. You find that while relationships are
significant, periods of seclusion are needed for you to integrate the spiritual
changes you are experiencing.
