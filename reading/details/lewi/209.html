protect you. You know when you've found your true love, because something deep
inside you opens up and transports you. Although you have some tendency to hold
unrealistic expectations of those you love, you do it in such a caring manner
that people are surprised by apparently miraculous changes. You may know when
it's time to forgive and move on, which allows you to remain open to feelings of
