<h3>91</h3>
<p>
You have a socially warm, enthusiastic personality, with a good deal
of charisma and poise. The great intensity of Scorpio, producing an
abundance of energy and vitality, is socialized by the amiable and
breezy Libra. The blend marries the emotional forces, determination
and will of Scorpio to the perceptiveness, mental equilibrium and
friendliness of Libra. You are a likable and charming person who is
certainly able to capture the hearts and minds of men, by being eager
to please and ready to help. There is a degree of vanity in your
nature giving you a strong sense of exactly how things should
look. You insist on balance and harmony in your environment, and this
definitely extends to your personal dress and appearance. Your
surroundings must be up to the standard that you consider acceptable,
and your friends must, likewise, live up to your rather lofty
standards, preferably living on the "right side of the tracks," as
well. A suspicious nature, absent in your youth, develops a you
mature. As this occurs, you become less direct, and more
discriminating. Your judgment in maturity contains an extraordinarily
high degree of good taste and idealism. Your self-confidence amounts
almost to pride, but rarely becomes offensive. You know how to put
everyone at ease and make an incomparable host/hostess. Your circle of
friends is wide and diverse. In romantic relationships you are keenly
"tuned-in" to the other, and you are tolerant of their wishes and
always sensitive to their needs.
