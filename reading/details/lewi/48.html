<h3>48</h3>
<p>
You have a highly fluid nature with much emotional depth. You store a
constant flow of impressions and your instincts and hunches are
usually very accurate. Your polarity reveals that your personality
blends harmoniously with your individuality, but also accentuates your
emotional nature, making you mentally receptive and
impressionable. You have a very peaceable and amenable personality,
and is agreeable and rarely on the wrong side of an argument;
agreeable, friendly and diplomatic. Not a fighter, you are so affable
and pleasant that is sometimes hard to tell where you stand or how
long you are going to stand there. This is not to say you don't have
ideas, but you keep them to yourself rather than produce conflict and
turmoil. Your practical or political sense is so clear and your
ability to apply tact to most situations usually assure you success in
most endeavors, but you may have to develop your self-confidence and
be a little more willing to act on your hunches and highly accurate
intuition. You're suspicious of others, and you may keep many secrets
locked inside. In fact, you are self-protective, a bit defensive, and
some would say too cautious, a good deal of the time; but because of
this, very able to protect yourself from designing people. Never easy
to fool, you have good business sense and the ability to drive a good
bargain. You can be popular in a large broad way with groups of
people, though in personal contacts you are likely to remain a little
suspicious and overly careful.
