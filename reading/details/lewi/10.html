<h3>10</h3>
<p>
Your sign blends the attributes of the Ram (Aries) and the Goat
(Capricorn), equipping you well for the task of battering and
climbing. This position gives natural talents for managing and
directing as the driving force of Aries is tempered with the
persistence and deliberate judgment of Capricorn. You have an inner
drive for success that is rarely equaled. There are also very definite
ideas about where you are going and how you are going to get there;
and you're not one to let anything stand in your way. In many ways you
are an opportunist who knows how to judge people, spot problem people,
and problem situations, before they get the upper hand. You may not
get to your goals as quickly as many fellow Aries, since avoiding the
pitfalls and waiting for the chance that is really what you want. This
is a strength that other Aries may not possess. Nonetheless, your
drive is always hard, and fast, compared to normal standards. Though
you are full of energy and determination, and you seem to waste very
little of these on nonproductive activities. You seem to know how to
direct your efforts to get what you want. Being a very worldly person,
fame and recognition are your top priorities or at least very near the
top. You will give up a lot in a personal sense for success. You may
make a good spouse, but marriage is not likely to be all important in
your life, but rather an event. The career may be foolishly placed
ahead of family. Your intellect is not unsound, but abstract knowledge
or knowledge for its own sake, holds little appeal to you. Common
sense seems much more valuable so far as you are concerned.
