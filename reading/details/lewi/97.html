are apt to work hard for the common good so long as it advances your
own personal ambitions and satisfies your desire to be in the
forefront of the action. You are defiant and extremely
self-confident. You are sure of your manner and consequently, you
handle people with the greatest of natural ease. You love to assume
responsibility and you'll move in and take over wherever you can. This
placement blends the sincerity, directness of manner, expressiveness
and versatility of Sagittarius with the assertiveness, personal
ambition and enthusiastic spirit of Aries. Excitement, adventure,

can get in your way. Restless, impulsive or precipitant in action, you

a hurry which can lead to carelessness at times. Test ideas and plans

you made it up in the beginning. You are a leader and things move
