<h3>240</h3>
<p>
Your are leader. It could be said that you are an eccentric in some ways but you
are free in thought and action. However, your free ways do not effect your
success potential - for that, you must learn nuance and diplomacy. If your
zodiac already carries angles of creativity, originality and management skills,
this square will increase all of them. On the downside, this angle might add a
bit of gruffiness, but it will nevertheless make you a strong and effective
personality. You propogate some sort of "electric" around you which makes
effects people around you even though they might not like your behavior or your
methods.

<br/><br/>

In zodiacs which carry no management skill, this angle will have no effect. In
this case, you will have an uncommon destructive personality whose primary
target will be yourself. You must protect yourself against this intense nervous
condition.
