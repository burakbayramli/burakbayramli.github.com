<h3>277</h3>
<p>
Your philosophical and religious outlook are helplessly out of synch with
reality to be of any use to you. Superstition, empty beliefs can damage
religious beliefs and way of life. Your sixth sense is pushing you towards
things that "you would like to believe were true", you must stay away from them
at all costs. Never act without thinking on these senses first. Before you join
living beings, you must build a strong foundation for your life.
