<h3>36/9</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
Having contacted the core of their true rather than their idealized needs,
desires, and feelings, the inner senses and intuitive wisdom of these
individuals are wide open. With a deep acceptance and knowledge of reality, they
can see a more perfect vision of self and world, yet they have learned to
appreciate both as they are now -- as perfection in process. They still confront
self-doubt, but they have found the courage to walk a straight line past their
doubt, going where Spirit leads them. Whether their life looks conventional or
unconventional, they live by higher laws and ideals and see the depths and
higher possibilities of life. They connect to this world through service as they
express the eternal wisdom they have contacted.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals live to please others. Their expression is blocked as they
allow themselves to be defined by others' opinions. Judgmental about themselves
and others, they are quick to spot imperfections but feel hypersensitive to any
criticism. High-strung, nervous, and hindered by self-doubt, they play it safe,
sticking with the conventional, the routine, and the familiar, since new
territory would bring the risk of failure, which would only add to their
disappointment in self and world. Reality never seems to meet their expectations
or hopes.
