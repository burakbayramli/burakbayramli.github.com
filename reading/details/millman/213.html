<h3>21/3</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals do brilliant and sensitive work; they include some of the most
creative people on the planet.  Their body is relaxed, supple, and relatively
free of tension because they express their feelings as they arise, honestly and
openly, rather than storing them as neuromuscular tensions.  They breathe deeply
and easily.  Their relationships thrive on honesty and emotional acceptance;
when problems arise, they talk those problems over and resolve them.  These
individuals feel genuine pleasure in uplifting others through their caring
words, whether through teaching, acting, singing, writing, or working in a
grocery store.  The occupation doesn't matter, as long as they have
opportunities to reach out to people and build emotional bridges.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
These hypersensitive individuals give mixed messages; they act confident and
then collapse under the weight of criticism.  They come back with cutting
remarks and hurt back or withdraw, all without revealing their authentic
feelings.  Over time, their physical tension and lack of suppleness reflect the
degree of emotion they are suppressing.  Filled with self-doubt and stifled
emotions, insecurity and blocked creativity, stubbornness and reactivity, they
fool no one but themselves.
