<h3>42/6</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
Bright, gregarious, productive, and supportive, these individuals have a good
relationship with friends and associates. Their practical analytical ability
blends common sense with high vision. They act with strong conscience and want
to learn from their mistakes and continue to improve themselves and their
world. Strong, healthy, and energy packed, these individuals can be counted upon
to get any job done as their work evolves from good to brilliant. They are
always improving, always pushing toward perfection, but they accept the
step-by-step process from where they are to where they want to be. They have a
good sense of balance; they know how to give graciously and how to
receive. Practical idealists, they appreciate themselves and others and find joy
in the world.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals feel frustrated and impatient with their life because nothing
meets their high standards or happens as quickly as they would
like. Impractical, impatient dreamers, they start out with a burst of enthusiasm
and effort, but if they don't succeed quickly, they soon abandon ideas and plans
without really giving them a chance to develop ("What's the use?"). They
idealize people they meet, then feel disappointed to learn that those people
have their own issues to work through. Hypersensitive to criticism because
they're so critical of themselves, they don't t listen well to others' feedback
or advice, and they make the same mistakes over and over again.
