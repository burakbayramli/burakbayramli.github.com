If the North Node is in Leo or the fifth house, the personâ€™s greatest growth,
evolution, and fulfillment come through performing creative acts, attaining
recognition, and developing the ego. Self-expression and personal power are
essential. In past lives, the person may have been detached, unemotional, and
indifferent to approval and acknowledgment. Now he must seek out status,
accolades, leadership, and honor.

Above all, he must create a life which is regarded as significant and
meaningful. Theatre and film are favored, as are all other artistic endeavors.
The person should strive for prominence and fame. He should promote
himself and his work. He must abandon his past-life tendencies of modesty,
altruism, and obscurity.

always being with friends and companions. Now he must delve deeply into
passionate love affairs and matters of the heart. He should enjoy the pleasures
of romance and sensuality. Children are extremely important and fulfilling.

his influence will live on through his pupils. He must act with integrity,
honesty, and warmth.

the dictates and opinions of others. He is here for his own needs, concerns,
and pleasures, not for those of society. He should honor his desires and
instincts more than his rational mind.

Pride, dignity, and self-respect should be cultivated. The person has to realize
the unique and special nature of his personality. He should work on
developing confidence and a regal demeanor. The more he becomes the
center of attention, the greater his evolution will be and the faster he will
attain perfection. He should guard against shyness, timidity, and an
unassuming manner.

The person gains great benefit from fun and pleasure, and should immerse
himself in earthly matters. The person may enjoy sports, stocks, and all other
forms of speculation. Careers involving entertainment and personal creativity
are favored. Faith and loyalty in this life are important.

metaphysical friends and groups, and a strong ability to realize major goals
and ambitions in life. Sign positions of the nodes are less significant.
