If the North Node is in Virgo or the sixth house, the person’s greatest growth,
evolution, and fulfillment come through routine service, daily work, and
attention to details. In past lives, the person has been dreamy, idealistic,
religious, and spiritual. Now he must focus on practical matters and learn to
deal with boundaries, essentials, and necessities.
Careers involving nursing, cooking, haircutting, etc. are all favored. Or, the
person may fulfill his destiny in any pursuit dealing with knowledge and
information. He may be a good writer, editor, accountant, or bookkeeper. The
person must investigate, analyze, and evaluate on a daily basis.
The person may have been born wanting to help everyone else, with little
concern for his own personal needs. Although this is a life of service to
others, the person must also focus on his own self-improvement. He should
take care of the quality of his appearance and the food he eats. Health matters
are important, and the person should exercise and learn about preventative
medicine and healing techniques.
He has to relinquish his easygoing ways, and make a lifestyle of
discriminating, judging, and attaining perfection in earthly matters. He should
work on precision, manual dexterity, technical skills, and any crafts of his
choice. Duty and discipline are crucial in this lifetime.
The person should be picky. He should be cautious, careful, and should seek
to understand the details and mechanics of things. The more knowledge he
gains, the happier he will be. His task is to categorize and compartmentalize,
and create order wherever chaos exists. He should leave wisdom, idealism,
and broad perspectives to philosophers. His efforts should be directed toward
solving problems and overcoming obstacles. He is a good organizer.
Old tendencies of intense sacrifice should be avoided. The person is here for
minor service and he will suffer if he acts the part of “savior,” or allows
others to take advantage of his generous nature. Enjoyment of small pets is
favored. Purity and innocence are essential, and the person must never
function out of improper motives.
If the North Node happens to fall in the sixth house in the Hindu/Vedic chart
(which is likely in approximately 70% or 75% of the cases), there will be very
strong health and a powerful appetite. The person defeats his enemies and
competitors with ease, and therefore may reach the top of his chosen field
32with little interference or resistance. The South Node (Ketu) in the twelfth is
good for spiritual growth and enlightenment. The nodes in the signs are of
much less significance.
