If the North Node is in Pisces or the twelfth house, the person’s greatest
growth, evolution, and fulfillment come through serving others in a profound
way. In past lives, the person concentrated on daily work, mundane tasks, and
his own perfection and self-improvement. Now he is to devote his energy to
idealistic callings, benevolent endeavors, and the betterment of humankind.
The person may be drawn to medicine, psychology, metaphysics, mysticism,
religion, or any activity which heals or uplifts others. Or he may relieve the
pain and suffering of the masses through heartfelt artistic expression. Singing
is favored.
The person is learning to let go of his old patterns of criticizing, evaluating,
and picking things apart. Now he must be as generous as he can be. He should
give, give, and then give more. He should live from the heart, not the mind.
Happiness comes from working to further the highest vision of human life,
with no thought of personal gain. The more noble and virtuous the person’s
motives, the faster and greater his evolution will be.
The person should cultivate faith and develop his spiritual nature. His main
task is to transcend self-interest. He should adopt a lifestyle of love,
compassion, and understanding. Above all, he must never condemn or judge
others, even the worst of the human race. When he does, he brings sorrow,
grief, and shame onto himself. The higher part of his being will not tolerate
small and narrow behavior.
The person should champion the cause of peace, harmony, and humanitarian
efforts. He must look for the best in others and refrain from gossip, negativity,
and pessimism. Of all possible life paths, his is the highest and most majestic.
He should consider the spirit behind peoples’ actions, and bear in mind the
complexity and rigor of human life.
The person is not here to be cautious, careful, and sensible. He is seeking
enlightenment and ultimate freedom. He wants to live a life of purity,
devotion, and union with the Infinite. He must pursue his ideals, visions, and
inspirations. Material comforts are of little importance.
The person may wish to perform major service. He may work in hospitals,
clinics, nursing homes, or other institutions which aid society. He must follow
his intuition and feelings. He will be happy living near the sea. Artistic
endeavors are favored.
48If the North Node happens to fall in the twelfth house in the Hindu/Vedic
chart (which is likely in approximately 70% or 75% of the cases), there are
cravings for spiritual growth and “moksha” — final liberation. There may
also be intense sexual enjoyment. The South Node (Ketu) in the sixth house
reveals very strong health, excellent ability to defeat enemies and
competitors, and daily work involving metaphysical healing techniques. The
nodes in the signs are of much less significance.
