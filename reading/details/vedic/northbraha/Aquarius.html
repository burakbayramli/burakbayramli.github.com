If the North Node is in Aquarius or the eleventh house, the person’s greatest
growth, evolution, and fulfillment come through performing altruistic acts for
society, getting involved with groups and friends, and developing a sense of
detachment. In past lives the person may have been extremely proud,
renowned, and ego-oriented. Now he is here to care for people in his
community.
He must let go of emotional attachments, and seek to improve existing
conditions of the common person. He should try to locate and abolish
outdated forms and structures, and implement new, innovative, efficient
methods wherever he can. The person should not place great attention on
children, intense love affairs, or deeply personal pursuits.
He should favor his mind, not his impulse. He must cultivate the intellect and
allow his rational mind to take precedence. Science and research endeavors
are favored. Rules, regulations, dogma, and rhetoric are not to be greatly
regarded. The person is learning a much more impersonal style of
functioning. He is concerned with knowledge, information, and truth, and is
relinquishing old habits of sentimental convictions and individual preferences.
Commitment to ideals, especially the betterment of humankind, is crucial.
The person must perceive life from the viewpoint of society. He should take
life easy, not intensely. He should meet with friends and groups regularly, and
try to discover causes and campaigns worth furthering. Freedom, liberty, and
equality for all must always be supported.
Fame and recognition are psychologically unimportant. The person may be a
pioneer or revolutionary, but he should never allow his reputation to go to his
head. He should favor activities that have never been done before. He does
well with utopian movements, current fads, and prevailing crazes. He should
generally avoid speculations, gambling, intense passions, and profound
romance. His purpose is humanitarian.
If the North Node happens to fall in the eleventh house in the Hindu/Vedic
chart (which is likely in approximately 70% or 75% of the cases), there is a
great ability to fulfill one’s major lifetime goals and desires. The person earns
plenty of wealth from “side ventures,” and he has powerful, influential, and
worldly friends.
The South Node (Ketu) in the fifth house means the person’s “poorvapunya”
or past life credit is connected to spirituality and psychic experience. In other
45or past life credit is connected to spirituality and psychic experience. In other
words, in previous lifetimes the person worked hard on spiritual and psychic
matters, and in this life he gains the benefits. Ketu in the fifth does not
produce many children, but those that are born will be introspective, psychic,
contemplative, and decidedly spiritual.
