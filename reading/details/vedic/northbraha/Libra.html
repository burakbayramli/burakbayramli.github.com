If the North Node is in Libra or the seventh house, the person’s greatest
growth, evolution, and fulfillment come through intimate contact in love
unions. In past lifetimes the person was too selfish or self-directed and now
must learn how to compromise and cooperate with his spouse. Love
relationships and marriage are essential and must not be resisted or opposed,
except under extenuating circumstances for brief intervals.
The person must discover how to surrender his personal motives and
viewpoints, and open up to the needs and concerns of his companion. He is
born with confidence, assertiveness, and self-reliance. He has an over-
developed personality and sense of independence.
Because the person has had his way in past lifetimes, he now, unconsciously,
finds that experience empty. Any love relationship the person enters will
entail a major compromise, which will not diminish in time. The person must
not in any way assume that a marriage partner will change or alter their
desires, behavior, or lifestyle in the future.
The sacrifices and concessions necessary in the beginning of the relationship,
though they may actually seem intense or unfair, are certain to continue. This
does not mean the person should allow his partner to treat him badly, but
when the other person’s needs are legitimate they should be honored.
The person should develop his social life. Happiness comes from lending a
sympathetic ear and cultivating sensitivity to the cares and needs of others.
Any activities involving beauty, arts, sweets, jewelry, or other Venusian
expressions should be favored. The person needs to work on being idealistic,
generous, and affectionate.
He should try to create balance, harmony, and serenity wherever he goes. The
more the person lets go of his own personal desires, and the more he
cultivates tolerance, love, and appreciation, the happier and more fulfilled he
will be.
If the North Node happens to fall in the seventh house in the Hindu/Vedic
chart (which is likely in approximately 70% or 75% of the cases), there will
be intense cravings for love relationships, as well as significant ups and
downs in married life. Minor issues, which need to be addressed, are
constantly arising. The spouse is worldly, materialistic, powerful, and
manipulative or domineering.
35The South Node (Ketu) in the first house indicates a spiritual, ascetic, and
psychic personality. However, confidence is weakened and the person may be
shy, impish, or rather invisible. The nodes in the signs are of less significance.
