If the North Node is in Taurus or the second house, the personâ€™s greatest
growth, evolution, and fulfillment come through appreciation and enjoyment
of earthly pleasures. In past lives, the person has been preoccupied with the
profundity of life, mysticism, spiritual development, and helping others find
their values and self-worth. It is now time to expand the practical side of
being, and experience manifest creation to the fullest. The person should
focus on wealth, comforts, and the arts etc.
Collections of any kind are very much to be favored. The person must let go
of patterns of detachment and indifference, and engage fully and passionately
in life. Enjoyment of the physical universe is the path to happiness, spiritual
integration, and higher realms of awareness.
The person should concern himself with personal security. He needs to take
jobs that are steady and stable, and that allow him to cultivate a conservative,
systematic manner. Endeavors involving agriculture, gardening, or
archeology will bring satisfaction and delight. The person should surround
himself with beauty, and take his appearance seriously. He must honor the
qualities of patience, consistency, firmness, and determination.
Above all, he must learn to acknowledge and value his own personal needs
and desires. He should seek out the real and tangible, and remain somewhat
skeptical of that which he cannot see, smell, hear, touch, or taste. Self-identity
is extremely important during this lifetime, and the person is developing
loyalty, balance, and equanimity.
Sex may be enjoyed for the sensuality and sheer pleasure of the experience,
but not as a means of gaining power, indulging in passion, or losing his
identity to another. Unless other aspects of the birthchart indicate otherwise,
the person may have little desire for the occult or mystical side of life. He is
not much concerned with psychological transformation and spiritual methods
of evolutionary growth.
If the North Node happens to fall in the second house in the Hindu/Vedic
chart (which is likely in approximately 70% or 75% of the cases), it is a
troublesome placement. The reason is that the second house, in the ancient
predictive system, is considered family life; either node there causes
suffering. Happiness in general is disturbed, and there may be marital strife
and discord. Ketu in the eighth house is good for intuition and psychic ability.
Sign positions are of little significance.
