If the North Node is in Cancer or the fourth house, the personâ€™s greatest
growth, evolution, and fulfillment come through taking care of his home and
family life. In previous incarnations there may have been an abundance of
professional activities and social responsibility. Now the person must
concentrate on his own soul growth and fulfillment of emotional needs. All
activities involving land, property, and homes are favored. The person is
talented with land and homes, and may wish to engage in real estate. He
should develop his feminine and maternal energy, and seek to nurture those in
his presence.
The person should dedicate his life to family, children, relatives, and loved
ones. He may do well in healing professions, nursing, cooking, catering,
innkeeping, or any domestically-oriented jobs. Although career focus is
neither psychologically significant nor a main objective of this life, the person
is extremely concerned with the well-being of all members of his immediate
community. He must do his best to see that everyone has a sense of
belonging.
The person is here to experience and appreciate the full value of his emotions,
senses, and passions. His job is to keep his family and others alive and well.
Tradition, rituals, and cultural values are of great importance. The person is
on a lifelong journey back to his roots. Spiritually, this means he is well-
advised to engage in meditation, contemplation, and all inner-directed self-
development techniques. Also, he gains great benefits from periods of self-
imposed seclusion and isolation.
On a more mundane level, the person wants to learn everything possible about
the lives, history, and circumstances of his ancestors and predecessors. At the
beginning of life the person is organically connected to his father. However,
as time goes by, he shifts his attention to his mother.
The person is devoted to practicalities, not ideals. He is sympathetic, and
functions as a support system to those in need. He is like a rock of stability,
always emotionally available for others. In this lifetime, the person is learning
devotion and loyalty to his loved ones. He may derive pleasure from
gardening, landscaping, or farming. Material possessions are important.
The person must have control over his daily environment. He should surround
himself with beauty and whatever else appeals to his personal tastes. Living
near water is preferred, and the person may wish to develop his psychic,
26sensitive nature to the fullest. He is here for a subjective, even sentimental,
experience of life and is now relinquishing his obsession with objective
realities and ultimate truths. The person may do well in mining, archeology,
or any ecological vocation.
If the North Node happens to fall in the fourth house in the Hindu/Vedic chart
(which is likely in approximately 70% or 75% of the cases), there will be
problems with a forceful or domineering mother. There are strong cravings in
the heart, and a possibility of attaining large homes or mansions.
The South Node (Ketu) in the tenth house reveals a good reputation and
successful professional life. Careers may involve any spiritual activity which
raises the consciousness of the common person. There is distinct talent in
metaphysical or natural healing techniques. The sign positions of the nodes
are of much less significance.
