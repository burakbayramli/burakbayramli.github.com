If the North Node is in Scorpio or the eighth house, the personâ€™s greatest
growth, evolution, and fulfillment come through relinquishing his desires for
possessions, and helping others to determine their values. In past lifetimes,
the person has been attached to his money and acquisitions, and engrossed in
his cravings for personal security. Now he is learning how to surrender and
merge with energies separate from his own.
Success and happiness will be found in pursuits involving the occult,
metaphysics, mysticism, and psychic work. The person may also do well in
politics or other fields which promote causes or campaigns for the good of
others. The person should not concern himself too much with his own self-
identity and intimate pleasures. He is here for greater purpose and profundity.
Good results occur when the person concentrates on spiritual evolution, soul
growth, and psychological transformation. He should focus on ideals,
paradigms, and ultimate realities rather than what can be gained from the
mundane, physical universe. Sexual experiences are deep, significant, and
valuable. The person transcends individuality and merges profoundly through
the orgasmic experience.
Appearances and physical beauty are not so important. The person must seek
that which is deep, real, spiritual, and lasting. He should open himself to all
kinds of experiences, without trying to pick and choose the good versus the
bad. The person should welcome his newly-vulnerable nature and embrace
whatever ego death-and-rebirth experiences come his way.
If the North Node happens to fall in the eighth house in the Hindu/Vedic chart
(which is likely in approximately 70% or 75% of the cases), there will be
domestic troubles. Family life is harmed and there are disturbances in married
life. Happiness may be harmed. However, there will be good spiritual and
mystical experiences. Also, money can be earned from metaphysical or
natural healing techniques. The sign positions of the nodes are much less
significant.
