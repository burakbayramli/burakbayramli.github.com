If the North Node is in Gemini or the third house, the person’s greatest
growth, evolution, and fulfillment come through mental expression and
rational analysis of objective truth. In past lifetimes, the person may have
been idealistic and emotional in his thinking. Now he must use
discrimination, and focus on facts and figures in the here and now. He should
follow his instincts of avoiding dogmas, creeds, religions, and higher
philosophies.
The person gains little from meditation, metaphysics, and any disciplines
which are not verifiable through traditional science. The person suffers when
he goes by faith. He does not fare well whenever he follows blindly. He must
abide by his newfound skepticism, and make his way to the truth by way of
logic and reasoning.
Happiness will be found in mental professions such as teaching, lecturing,
debating, and writing. The person is a good salesman. He thrives on city life
and should be as active as possible. Public relations or coordinating-type
careers are favored. During previous incarnations, the person was sentimental,
philosophical, and taken with theories, principles, doctrines, and conjectures.
Now he must plant his feet firmly on the ground and embrace the notion that
“what you see is what you get.” The person should cultivate good relations
with siblings and relatives. He must work on versatility and adaptability, and
try to experience as much variety and “spice of life” as possible. The person
may often find himself thrust into situations that require precision and
attention to details.
The daily environment is important, long distance travel is not. The person is
well-advised to meet as many people as possible and continually expand his
social life. He should avoid trying to predict the future, except through
investigation and statistical research. The more he gains of useful information
and practical knowledge, the happier he will be and the greater his growth and
evolution.
He must not allow his feelings and emotions to interfere when trying to
understand an issue. The person should not concern himself with broad
viewpoints, abstract ideas, fanciful inspirations, and spiritual realities. He
must learn through personal experience, not gurus and mentors.
Many Western astrologers consider the North Node in Gemini to be exalted.
This is interesting in that it relates to one of the paths of enlightenment taught
23This is interesting in that it relates to one of the paths of enlightenment taught
in India known as Advaita or non-duality. In that system, the person gains
higher consciousness through intellectual understanding, and by dispelling the
mistake of the intellect. Non-dualists are unconcerned with purifying the
nervous system or spiritual devotion. Freedom comes from addressing and
answering the question “Who am I?” or “Who is this ME?”
A person with the North Node in Gemini is gifted in analyzing this question
because he avoids beliefs and dogma and goes strictly by his own experience
and intellectual analysis. This process, when done with extreme diligence,
leads to the discovery that the material universe is a dream (called maya in the
East) and the individual identity is nothing more than a false, mind-created,
reference point.
A person with the North Node in Gemini or the third house has an easier time
with practicalities than anyone else. He pays attention and quickly learns how
things work.
If the North Node happens to fall in the third house in the Hindu/Vedic
(which is likely in approximately 70% or 75% of the cases), there will be an
enormously strong will and an interesting personality. The person is
courageous and adventurous. He works well with his hands, has intense
cravings, and fulfills his desires easily.
The South Node (Ketu) in the ninth house may indicate troubles with
religious or spiritual teachers. Or the person may have a guru or mentor who
is strange, weird, occult-like, introverted, or invisible in a way. The sign
positions in Hindu astrology are much less significant.
