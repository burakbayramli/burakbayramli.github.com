If the North Node is in Sagittarius or the ninth house, the personâ€™s
greatest growth, evolution, and fulfillment come through pursuing
religion, philosophy, and higher knowledge. In past lives the person
was intellectual, analytical, meticulous, precise, and skeptical. Now
he should cultivate faith, and concentrate on ideals, paradigms, and
the ultimate truth of existence.  The person should use wisdom and
seek broad viewpoints. He must give credence to his intuition,
feelings, and inspirations. He must take his visions and prophecies
seriously, and give little importance to the petty and inconsequential
in daily life. The person gains his greatest happiness by devoting his
energies to spiritual ideals, mystical movements, and enlightened
gurus. He is gifted in promoting religion or any other knowledge which
raises the consciousness of the masses. Publishing, as a career, is
favored.  The person must continually discriminate between right and
wrong, and even make a discipline of the process. He should seek
freedom and liberation, and develop his social conscience. Beliefs,
principles, and morals are everything, and the person must maintain a
positive outlook under all circumstances.  The person is eternally
concerned with profundities. He knows the meaning of life is to find
perfection and God. The person should seek to increase his generosity
and charitable nature. Travel is a source of evolution, and the person
may wish to engage in foreign affairs. He should have a lot of fun and
recreation.  The person may pay little attention to relationships with
siblings and relatives.  He must relinquish his previously constricted
or microscopic way of thinking and allow his perception and insights
to take him to the highest interpretation of life that is possible.
If the North Node happens to fall in the ninth house in the
Hindu/Vedic chart (which is likely in approximately 70% or 75% of the
cases), there will be cravings for religion and higher knowledge, as
well as long distance travel.  However, there may also be difficulties
with the father and religious or spiritual teachers.  The South Node
(Ketu) in the third house means that the person is strong- willed,
exciting and adventurous, and good at fulfilling his desires. It also
signifies a spiritual, introspective, or introverted younger
sibling. The nodes in the signs are of much less significance.
