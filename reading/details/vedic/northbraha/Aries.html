  If the North Node is in Aries or the first house, the personâ€™s greatest growth,
evolution, and fulfillment come through developing his own personality and
personal power. He has been too dependent on marriage partners and other
people in past lives, and has relinquished his individuality and authority to
them. The person must follow his instincts and impulses, and learn to care for
his own destiny.
He must not allow himself to be dominated, manipulated, or overshadowed by
the feelings and wishes of others. There is a great likelihood that the person
will become enmeshed in an early marriage and soon feel smothered and
controlled. He is likely, with great effort, pain, and struggle, to eventually free
himself from that bond in order to develop and nurture his own personality,
ambitions, and self-expression. Then the possibility of growth, satisfaction,
and a sense of accomplishment becomes a reality.
The person should beware of compromising too quickly and easily. He must
work on confidence and self-reliance, and use his own judgment. He will be
happier and healthier when he learns to value his own opinions and stand up
for himself. The person gains a great deal from decisiveness and dynamic
action, and should therefore take the initiative as much as possible. Men or
women with this North Node placement are well-advised to cultivate and
nurture their masculine side.
The person should be more assertive, and express his emotions when
provoked. He must not, in the event of anger or irritability, give in to his
habitual patterns of suppression and self-denial. In this lifetime, his
individuality, self-esteem, and ego needs are essential.
The person must let go of his compulsion to create peace and harmony in his
environment. Toward this end, he will be forever thrust into circumstances
where he feels compelled to declare his convictions and take appropriate
action. The person should focus on his physical body, be more daring, and
allow the fiery element of his personality to come through more often.
If the North Node happens to fall in the first house in the Hindu/Vedic chart
(which is likely in approximately 70% or 75% of the cases), there will be a
beautiful and powerful appearance, serious ups and downs in married life, and
a strange, eccentric, or highly spiritual spouse. John Lennon is a good
example. Sign positions of the nodes are of less significance.
