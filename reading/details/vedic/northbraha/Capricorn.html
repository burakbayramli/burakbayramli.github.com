  If the North Node is in Capricorn or the tenth house, the person’s greatest
growth, evolution, and fulfillment come through concentrated career activity.
In previous lives, the person may have led existences that were personal and
emotionally acute. Now he must come out to the public and direct his
energies toward society. The person is born with deep, organic ties to his
mother. He is extraordinarily sensitive to his early family life and all the
surrounding conditions and circumstances. However, he soon learns that his
niche in the world derives from activities that capture the attention and notice
of humankind at large.
He becomes increasingly intimate with his father and other authoritarians
with each passing year. More than any other astrological placement, the
person with this North Node placement may feel a sense of purpose and
destiny. He is very ambitious and likely to succeed in his professional life. He
may find his calling early on and move toward the work like an arrow to its
target.
There is leadership ability and the possibility of fame. Although the North
Node signifies new realms for the soul to master (realms that may seem scary
or intimidating), the person is courageous about pursuing his ultimate dreams
and visions. Homes, land, and property are not much favored unless the
person has decided that real estate is the domain in which to make his mark.
Though he never forgets his connection to family, ancestors, and the past, the
person is actively forging a new path toward a much broader base of
influence.
The person should beware of workaholic tendencies or his personal life will
suffer. He is likely to marry a partner who is particularly devoted to home and
domesticity, a spouse who will not disturb his involvement in his mission. He
must direct his attentions to large-scale organizing, rather than close friends
and loved ones.
The person should concern himself with fame, prestige, and status. He should
seek to become an authority figure in his field. His sense of security comes
from his work and reputation, not possessions or home life. He is moving
away from a highly subjective, feeling-oriented existence to one of hard work
and fulfillment of ideals. He sets high goals and allows nothing to stand in his
way.
The person should not engage in contemplation, meditation, introspection,
42and seclusion for more than brief, intermittent periods of time. His duties are
social and his greatest happiness comes from being with people on a regular
basis. His work must produce results that withstand the test of time. He
should never lose himself in theories and abstractions.
In dealing with the masses, the person must be careful not to get trapped into
giving too much time and energy to specific individuals. He must always
remember his larger purpose. Professions involving one-on-one contact are
not desirable; they will not be fulfilling for any length of time.
If the North Node happens to fall in the tenth house in the Hindu/Vedic chart
(which is likely in approximately 70% or 75% of the cases), there is a potent
and thriving career. The person is especially capable of affecting and
influencing the masses. Career success grows stronger after the forty-second
year, when Rahu is considered to “mature.” The South Node (Ketu) in the
fourth house means weird or strange difficulties with homes, cars, and
mother. It also indicates an innately spiritual nature and religious pilgrimages
throughout the lifetime. The nodes in the signs are much less significant.
