Leo and Aquarius are the signs of selfhood and group activity, the
royals (Leo) versus those who keep it real (Aquarius). Use our cosmic

Aquarius North Node? If you born with a Leo north node or an Aquarius
north node, your destiny involves a path of balancing between the
spotlight (Leo) and being a team player (Aquarius), self-gratifying
luxury and a bohemian or communal spirit. You could even think of Leo
energy as the “haves” and Aquarius energy as the “have nots.” People
with Leo and Aquarius north nodes can drift between privileged,
patrician worlds and some of the most spiritually and emotionally
impoverished ones. Their hearts can be big, but so can their
appetites. Leo is a regal sign that’s ruled by the Sun, which is the
center of our solar system. No surprise that some Leo south node
people are born thinking the world revolves around them! Their path is
to learn humility, but not at the expense of their dazzling inner fire
and glorious stage presence. Leo south nodes must learn to use their
theatrical ways for the betterment of all—or to forward a humanitarian
cause. Aquarius is the zodiac’s socialist, all about equality and
progressive social policies and activism. Peace icons Mahatma Gandhi
and Princess Diana were both born under the Aquarius south node. The
Leo north node/Aquarius south node person is a powerful changemaker,
but in this lifetime, they can get lost in a crowd. These people need
to channel their Leo “roar” to reach a wider audience. Once they do,
they can claim the spotlight and shine, spreading a message of
justice. While Leo north nodes care deeply about society as a whole,
they can be a bit cool and detached on a one-on-one level. Technology
and cutting-edge ideas can be their forte. Aquarius also rules
computers, math, science and quantum physics. Aquarius south node
people can bring their “mad scientist” brand of genius to the world,
especially through digital innovations and media. Embracing the Leo
north node path of glamour, courage and self-expression is their
life’s work. Otherwise, they can end up as the unappreciated
behind-the-scenes workers whose creativity and voices are
overlooked. When Leo north nodes take the spotlight, however, they
must stay humble. Otherwise, they can veer into unbridled narcissism
and ego trips. Interestingly, Leo north nodes Beyoncé and Justin
Timberlake were both part of major pop groups before breaking out as
solo artists, while Mick Jagger (also born with this node) is the
showy Rolling Stones frontman well into his 70s. Leo north node Tom
Cruise is equally famous for his blockbuster films (Leo) as for his
unabashed Scientology membership (Aquarius). And Leo north node Kim
Kardashian‘s star rose as part of an ensemble cast on her family’s
reality show. Her tech-savvy Aquarius south node gifts helped her
leverage fame through social media and her unforgettable “selfies.”
