      Taurus and Scorpio are the signs that rule money, power and
      sensuality. If you are born with a Taurus north node or a Scorpio
      north node, your destiny involves learning to balance the spiritual
      and material worlds. These Taurus and Scorpio north nodes exude sexual
      prowess, earthy sensuality and power. Channeling these dynamic forces
      in healthy, balanced ways can be a challenge, as these lunar nodes are
      prone to extremes. You are often pulled between the practical and
      mystical, the sensible and the spiritual. Use our cosmic calculator to

      north node people are learning to embrace “what could be” instead of
      fixating on “what is.” They have spent lifetimes steeped in material
      world as hardworking, practical people. They enjoyed spending money,
      and could resurface as arbiters of luxury and fine taste. Taurus rules
      the senses: touch, taste, smell, sound, sight. They might be gifted
      artists and musicians (Prince and Justin Bieber were both born with
      Scorpio north node) or have a keen sense of style (like iconic fashion
      designer Coco Chanel). This lifetime, indulgence and hedonism can be
      their downfall. Their Scorpio north node pries them away from the
      physical and into the spiritual realm. Scorpio north node people are
      learning about life beyond their senses and daily habits (work, eat,
      sleep, drink, screw, repeat). Scorpio also rules wealth and
      investments.

      These people are learning to make their money work for
      them, instead of just working for their money. Taurus North Node
      traits On the flip side, Taurus north node/Scorpio south node people
      have arrived here to work! In past lives, they were powerful and
      privileged people who were often born into wealth.  They may have been
      advisors to royalty or political leaders, working masterfully behind
      the scenes. Now, it’s their time to step into a position of public
      power, rolling up their sleeves and learning to be the providers,
      earners and do-ers. In this lifetime, inherited wealth or status is a
      burden, not a blessing. They yearn to be bootstrappers, proving that
      they can do it themselves! Many Scorpio south nodes need to break free
      of “golden handcuffs.” For example, they may have overprotective
      families who control them with emotional blackmail or often, by
      financing their lives (thereby eliminating the “need” to
      work). Fighting to be self-sufficient is often a struggle. What Taurus
      north node people should do is use their money, connections and
      influence to help open doors for people who don’t have their
      privilege. Scorpio is a mysterious sign, and the Scorpio south node’s
      challenge is to shed a veil of secrecy. While anonymity protected them
      in past lives, too much privacy now creates trouble. (Case in point:
      Scorpio south node Hillary Clinton’s private email account that led to
      a federal investigation.) These people can even earn a reputation as
      untrustworthy and calculating.

      Some Scorpio south node people are born into families with deep,
      dark secrets: addiction, abuse, corruption, crime. Their soul
      work is to move past shame. Taurus rules the throat chakra;
      Taurus north nodes are learning to speak out loud. What does
      Taurus North Node mean? Release (Scorpio south node) Seducing,
