Virgo and Pisces north nodes may veer into addiction or overcome
health challenges. Later, you can become teachers and guides for

Calculate Yours! What does it mean to have a Virgo or Pisces North
Node? Virgo is ruled by clever Mercury and is associated with the
analytical left brain. Pisces is ruled by dreamy Neptune and governs
the creative right brain. People with Virgo and Pisces lunar nodes are
constantly balancing fact versus fantasy, intuition versus logic. You
can be a masterful manifestation magnet but also a micromanager
seeking answers and explanations. While the skeptical Virgo south node
says “seeing is believing,” the mystical Pisces south node argues,
“believing is seeing.” At times, these nodes can go too far off the
woo-woo deep end. Other times, they can be overly hung up on material
proof and comforts. Your destiny may involve a career that is both
creative and technical. If you have a Pisces north node, you may have
mystical experiences that your rational mind struggles to
understand. If you have a Virgo north node, you may find it difficult
to follow the protocols and structures of the so-called “real world,”
preferring to be guided by your inner voice. Both lunar nodes can make
too many sacrifices, helping others at your own expense. Interestingly
enough, the most iconic martyr in history, Joan of Arc, was born with
a Pisces north node. What does Virgo North Node mean? Release (Pisces
