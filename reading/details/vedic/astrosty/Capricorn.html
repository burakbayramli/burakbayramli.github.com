If you were born with a Cancer north node or a Capricorn north node,
your life path involves balancing personal and professional endeavors,
home and work, masculine and feminine energy. Cancer rules the
feminine realm—home, family, women, maternal energy,
creativity. Capricorn rules the masculine realm—career, public life,
men, paternal energy and structure. You may often feel pulled
uncomfortably between the two, struggling to find work/life balance,
with Cancer and Capricorn north nodes. Use our cosmic calculator to

Calculate Yours! Cancer north node traits Depending on your node
placement, you may be more comfortable with one gender over the
other. Most likely you need to develop more ease with the gender
represented by your north node. Cancer north node people are learning
to understand women and feminine energy, and may be “one of the guys.”
The female Cancer north node is often quite girlish in appearance, but
can be structured, driven and single-focused on the inside. These
people have spent lifetimes as “captains of industry” and patriarchs,
conquering the world and accumulating wealth. Now, they are learning
that there’s more to life than just work and money. Cancer north node
people’s mission is to enjoy home, family and heartfelt
connections. However, many can be reluctant parents. Male or female,
they may prefer to express their newfound maternal energy as “work
moms” who nurture coworkers or acting as mentors. Caution: When Cancer
north nodes do get sentimental, their Hallmark moments can be
over-the-top and a little awkward. (These are the people who might
hang a “Live Laugh Love” plaque over their desks.) Capricorn north
node traits Capricorn north node people have had many lifetimes in the
feminine (Cancer) realm as caretakers, mothers, wives and
dependents. In this lifetime, they are learning the exciting new world
of self-sufficiency. Capricorn north nodes are moving from the role of
nurturer to the role of provider. However, too much time in the
corporate world depletes their souls. Even if they do go into an
office, they need to add homey touches and create familial bonds with
their coworkers. These are the people who bring cupcakes in or
organize the company picnic. Capricorn north nodes are creative and
intuitive, and need to apply these gifts to their goals. They may
resist structure (their least favorite moment is taking a shower and
leaving the house!). However, when they stick to a simple plan that
includes time for self-care, they thrive. Oprah Winfrey, a Capricorn
north node, is as famous for her book clubs and “favorite things”
shows as she is for her celebrity trainers, chefs and experts. Like
many self-soothing Cancer south node people, she struggles with yo-yo
dieting and emotional eating. Family matters for both nodes Family
relationships, especially with parents, are a major issue for Cancer
and Capricorn lunar nodes. You could be closer to the parent
represented by your south node (mothers for Cancer south node, fathers
for Capricorn south node). Your deepest evolution could involve
working to understand the parent represented by your north node
(fathers for Capricorn north node, mothers for Cancer north node). In
some cases, this parent may even be a distant or absent figure in your
life. If you have kids, many of your biggest life lessons will come
from balancing worldly achievements with your parental duties. What
