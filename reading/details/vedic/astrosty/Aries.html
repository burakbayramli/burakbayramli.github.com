      If you were born with an Aries north node or a Libra north node, your
      life path involves balancing between self and others, being the solo
      star and the best supporting actor. The theme of “me versus we” is a
      running thread throughout your life. Relationships are your karmic
      classroom as you balance between your own needs and those of
      others. You may swing between getting lost in relationships and
      fiercely protecting your autonomy. Use our cosmic calculator to

      Aries north nodes. In past lives as Libra peacekeepers they were never
      allowed to express discontent. This lifetime is “assertiveness
      training school.”  In the rare occasion they do get mad, their
      bottled-up anger can come out in frightening ways. Aries north nodes
      may even manifest bullying or rage-filled people until they make peace
      with their own anger. Their best path is to channel these emotions
      into justice work, championing the rights of people who have been
      silenced. Libra north node traits Libra north nodes walk the opposite
      path. With their fiercely independent Aries south nodes, they have
      spent lifetimes as free agents, operating independently and beholden
      to no one. In this go-round, they are learning how to play well with
      others. Sharing, compromise, diplomacy—Libra north nodes will have
      eye-opening experiences that teach them these traits. They may resist
      marriage or long-term relationships but also crave them. When and if
      they do commit, Libra north nodes need plenty of solo time and
      breathing room.

      independently and can’t stand to be micromanaged. Relationships matter
      for both nodes People with Aries north node/Libra south node have
      spent many lifetimes mastering relationships. In previous lives, they
      have been married and worked in close partnership. They come to this
      life with strong interpersonal skills, naturally seeking
      synergies. The risk is that they compromise too much or fail to

      arrangements before forming their own identities. Later in life, they
      may go back to blaze a solo trail. Aries north node people must
