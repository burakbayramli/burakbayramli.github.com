Gemini North Node and Sagittarius North Node Life Path Gemini and
Sagittarius are the signs of communication and learning. If you born
with a Gemini north node or a Sagittarius north node, your life
purpose could include teaching, learning, writing and spreading a
message. The Gemini and Sagittarius north nodes are constantly
gathering and disseminating knowledge. They are the most interactive
of all nodes and could have a wide array of friends and
acquaintances.

Sagittarius North Node traits Gemini rules local travel and familiar
faces, while Sagittarius is the global ambassador. If your north node
is in Sagittarius, you may be more comfortable in a close community
where you are well-known. Traveling (a Sagittarius-ruled pursuit)
could make you nervous, especially when you’re younger. You could even
have a phobia of flying! Yet, when you embrace the wider world, you go
through massive spiritual growth. Gemini is the sign of the Twins, and
Gemini south nodes are forever seeking a kindred spirit who “gets”
them. These people need to push themselves to branch out and take
risks, independent of their steady wingman. Gemini rules the hands and
these south node people may be gifted with theirs, working as
craftspeople, musicians, writers or hands-on healers. In past lives,
Gemini south nodes may have used their verbal prowess to manipulate
others. Some may even have been liars, petty thieves and con
artists. (Many Gemini south node people admit to small acts of
shoplifting or chronic fibbing as kids!)

In this lifetime, they must watch a tendency to twist words or play
with people’s minds. Others can fall prey to master manipulators and
guru figures, ending up as victims of deceit. Cultivating the
Sagittarius north node traits of honesty and big-picture perspective
can help these people rise into their highest selves, shedding the
karma of these past lives. Gemini North Node traits Gemini north node
people have the opposite dilemma. They’ve seen the world, have diverse
friends and lovers in every port, and now must learn to stay in one
place! If your south node is in worldly Sagittarius, you’ve had
lifetimes as a “Marco Polo” explorer type or a lofty, ivory tower
scholar. The Gemini north node person’s challenge is putting down
roots. They are also learning to see the world through a simple,
common-sense perspective, using facts instead of endlessly
philosophizing. The K.I.S.S. (“Keep It Simple Sweetheart”) acronym
should be their mantra. Forever on the go, Gemini north nodes may
resist settling into a community. Many Gemini north node people prefer
to live in large cities or university towns. Wanderlust strikes often,
and their jobs may involve travel, foreign language or
publishing.

They love to be around the Sagittarius-ruled energy of
higher learning and foreign influences. Gemini is the sign of verbal
communication. Gemini north node people are learning the art of
dialogue, versus the one-sided conversation.They may struggle with the
Sagittarius tendency toward bluntness and know-it-all arrogance. The
Gemini north node must develop better interpersonal communication
skills, such as active listening and mirroring. (Luckily, they can
indulge their Sagittarius south node passion for learning by taking
workshops about these very topics!) What does Gemini North Node mean?
