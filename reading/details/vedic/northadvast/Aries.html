        People who have this placement in their birth chart need to embrace
        the traits of Aries more. When young, this sign probably feels strange
        to you. If you have some other planets in Aries, this north node sign
        might be easier for you, as you are already familiar with the energy

        only in the second part of your life. Your soul wants to learn to be
        independent in this lifetime. At a young age, north node in Aries
        people tend to be too cooperative and they often don’t stand up for
        themselves even on occasions when they should. Being bold and direct
        is an important life lesson. Finding your identity is also important
        with the north node in Aries.In the birth chart, the nodal axis is of

        existing celestial objects, it would be a big mistake to underestimate
        their importance. These points represent what you have to learn in
        this lifetime. They are also referred to as Rahu and Ketu.

        to understand what your soul wants to learn in the future, it is

        The north node in Aries suggests that you want to take care of others,
        but in this process, you sometimes forget that you have needs, too.In
        the past, you were more often in a relationship than not, and it
        became natural for you to make compromises. The north node in Aries
        suggest a tendency to define yourself through others. You are eager to
        please and often afraid of being left on your own. When under
        pressure, there is a tendency to let others violate your boundaries
        instead of accidentally hurting someone’s feelings. This is
        particularly true in close relationships and one-on-one
        partnerships. A typical issue with the north node in Aries is that you
        often put others before yourself. At the same time, this can make you
        feel drained and make you feel that you give more than you get. Being
        selfish is very unfamiliar to you. However, it is important to take
        care of yourself and realize that the more you have, the more you can
        give to others (not just money, this can be anything, energy,
        inspiration, joy, etc.).The north node in Aries suggests that you need
        to learn to get what you want and actively pursue your goals. In the
        past, you might have relied too much on others, or you expected your
        partner to be perfect. This placement suggests that you need to be
        focused on yourself and be there for yourself more.With the south node
        in Libra, justice is very important for you. People with this
        placement strive to create balance. Conflicts make most people with
        this placement freak out, especially if they have to choose a
        side. You want harmony more than anything. However, this is not where
        growth can happen in this lifetime. It is time to be an individual and
        be more independent. This is not to say that you completely have to
        leave behind the traits of Libra. Not at all, but as time passes,
        Libra energy is likely to stay in the background, and you learn to
        appreciate the traits of the Ram more.

        North Node in AstrologyThere are two lunar nodes: the north node and
        the south node. These points are calculated as the intersection

        and their orbital period is approximately 18,6 years.The Moon’s nodes
        are very important in astrology. In the birth chart, they show what is
        the purpose of this incarnation, why your soul wanted to experience
        life. The lunar nodes are particularly significant in karmic
        astrology. If you don’t believe in reincarnation, you can treat them
        as your personal past in this lifetime, and the direction your future
        self wants to grow towards. The lunar nodes are also important in
        synastry, and someone’s planets conjunct these points in your chart
        (or vice versa) color the relationship to a great extent.What is the
        role of the north node and the south node in the birth chart?The lunar
        nodes are always placed directly opposite each other. If you have your
        north node in Scorpio in the third house, your south node is located
        in Taurus in the ninth house.The north node shows what life lessons
        your soul wants to learn in this lifetime. It represents a sign and
        life area that is relatively new to your soul. As such, it requires a
        great deal of effort and patience. But don’t worry, you’ll get there!
        The good thing about the north node is that once you start to align
        your life with it, you feel very happy and fulfilled. It is the
        amazing feeling of having a purpose. The north node is what can help
        you grow the most.The south node, on the other hand, tells a different
        story.
