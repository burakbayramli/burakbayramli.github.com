node is to listen. By just listening, you can get an idea about the

Wants You to Know but Will Never TellThe Moon’s Nodes in AstrologyThe
Moon’s nodes offer a wonderful way to find out why you were born and
what you are supposed to learn in this lifetime. They are particularly
important in karmic astrology, but even if you don’t believe in
reincarnation, you can learn a lot about yourself by studying the
nodes. In the birth chart (but also generally speaking), the nodes are
always placed directly opposite each other. If your north node is in
Gemini in the eleventh house, your south node is in Sagittarius in the
fifth house. There are two lunar nodes, the north node and the south
node. These points don’t represent existing celestial bodies. They are
fictional points, calculated as the intersection between the ecliptic
and the Moon’s orbit (this is why they are called lunar nodes). The
lunar nodes are also called Rahu (the north node) and Ketu (the south
node). It takes approximately 18,6 years for the lunar nodes to make a
full circle through the Zodiac.The north node is often described as
your spiritual mission, the life lessons your soul needs to learn in
order to grow. As it represents things new to you, the north node is
often a challenging point in the birth chart. This is particularly
true in the first part of your life.  The south node represents
something entirely different: the past. The south node tells where you
are coming from, what you already do very well. However, there is no
room for growth here. The south node is your comfort zone. There is a
strong pull to fall back on your south node, but this is not where
your soul can learn new things and level up.When analyzing the lunar
nodes in the birth chart, you need to take into consideration their
house, sign, and also the aspects they form with the planets,
especially the conjunctions and squares.The Zodiac Sign Gemini in
AstrologyWhat are some of the things you need to know about this
zodiac sign?Gemini is the mutable air sign in astrology. It is the
third sign of the Zodiac, which also means that it is connected with
the third house of learning and thinking in the natural chart (of
course, in your chart, it doesn’t have to be the Twins on the cusp of
your third house). Gemini is all about thinking, learning,
communicating with others. As an air sign, Gemini is fascinated by
wit. People with a strong Gemini in their charts are usually witty and
funny themselves, too. This sign is characterized by intelligence,
openness to learning, being curious, and gathering information all the
time. As the sign of communication and interacting with others, Gemini
is quite extroverted and it feels the best when it gets to talk to a
lot of people. Gemini is ruled by the planet Mercury. In the human
body, the lungs and limbs belong to this sign (among other body
parts). The weaknesses of Gemini include being impatient, all over the
place, sometimes insensitive, gossiping, nervousness. Gemini can lack
focus because they are always after new stimuli and they are often on
the go. Boredom (or what they perceive as such) makes the Twins freak
out.
