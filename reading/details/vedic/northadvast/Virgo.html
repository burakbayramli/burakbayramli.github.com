in AstrologyThe lunar nodes are not existing celestial objects, but
this doesn’t make them any less important in astrology.There are two
lunar nodes: the north node and the south node. They are always placed
directly opposite each other, this means that if your north node is in
Virgo in the third house, your south node is in Pisces in the ninth
house.But what are the north node and the south node, if they do not
exist in reality?These points are calculated as the intersection
between the orbit of the Moon and the ecliptic. In astrology, they are
connected with the growth process of your soul, often described as
your life purpose.In the birth chart, the north node shows what are
the key life lessons you need to learn in this lifetime, in order to
grow spiritually.The south node, on the other hand, shows what you
have already learned in the past. Since you already excel at the life
area represented by the house of your south node and the energy of its
sign is familiar to you, there is no more room for growth here.The
lunar nodes have strong karmic connotation and they are a very
important concept in karmic astrology.It takes approximately 18 months
for the nodes to move through a sign. They have an orbital period of
approximately 18,6 years.The Zodiac Sign VirgoVirgo is the mutable
