 chart, the north node shows what spiritual experience you are yet to
 learn. But in order to understand your future, it is important to
 reflect on the past. This is what the south node can help you
 with. The south node represents what is already familiar to you and
 what you had a lot of experience with in the past.Here’s what the
 north node in Taurus and south node in Scorpio suggest about your
 soul’s growth process.The south node in Scorpio suggests that you had
 your fair share of traumatic experiences in the past. Your childhood
 and early life was rarely stable with this placement. Scorpio is the
 sign of trauma: betrayal, loss of trust, abuse, manipulation all
 belong to the negative manifestation of this sign.People with a
 Taurus north node work towards creating a safe and stable environment
 as adults, as they often lacked this as kids. Because of the lack of
 good example, you struggle with this as an adult, but as time goes
 on, you become better and better at it. This position of the nodal
 axis often indicates an unconscious attraction to crisis. It is a
 very familiar state to you, and even though it objectively doesn’t
 serve you, you are drawn to recreating these scenarios in your
 life.Taurus is a very peaceful sign, while Scorpio is the sign of
 intensity. There is a tendency to disturb the waters of your life if
 there is nothing going on. You are attracted to drama, often drama
 caused by others. It can also happen that you are more interested in
 the life of others than your own life.The north node in Taurus
 suggests that you should focus more on yourself. You can pay too much
 attention to how others live and you often seek validation from
 them. The north node in Taurus suggests great people skills. You have
 a talent for psychology as in the past, you had many opportunities to
 learn about the human psyche. However, in this lifetime, it is better
 to focus on the tangible world.Scorpio is a mysterious,
 transcendental sign, opposed to the physical reality of the Bull. You
 feel this clash very strongly in your psyche. The north node in
 Taurus suggests that in the past, you were drawn to otherworldly
 experiences, sometimes at the price of not paying enough attention to
 your mundane, everyday life. You love unearthing secrets and you are
 pretty good at it. But the bottom line should be discovering secrets
 in order to make your life better, not to be involved with
 drama.North Node in Taurus: Finding Value WithinThe most important
 lesson the north node in Taurus teaches you is to find strength in
 yourself and have a solid self-esteem. You need to find your own
 value system. With the north node in Taurus, in the past, you often
 borrowed the value system of other people.One of the biggest
 weaknesses of a Taurus north node is defining your self-worth through
 others. Do others find me valuable? Do others appreciate me? It is
 the time to replace these questions with what I find valuable and
 what I appreciate. It is particularly important to define yourself
 based on your criteria alone. You need to support yourself and find
 your self-worth. Any method that leads to a healthy self-esteem is
 beneficial with this placement.The north node in Taurus suggests that
 in the past, you craved validation from partner and other
 people. However, by learning to give this validation to yourself,
 others become more appreciative of you and they usually start to
 value you more. The south node in Scorpio suggests a deep desire to
 merge with others. This is true on many levels, from finances to
 sex. People with their south node in Scorpio can put too much
 emphasis on sexuality. It can become a way for you to prove your
 worth, what is more often a trap than not. The Taurus north node
 suggests that it is time to feel worthy because of who you are, not
 because what you can share with others.As you mature and grow older,
 you are likely to be driven to create material stability. This
 placement can indicate an interest in finances, economy, art, food,
 all kinds of luxurious things. Some people with this placement end up

 the best with tangible things. It is important for you to have a life
 where you can spend time on things you consider valuable.A natal

 persistent. People with this placement build things step by
 step. There is little overnight success with this position. Taurus is
 the sign of persistence and perseverance. Taurus is also a sign that
 works on their own and enjoys building and creating, while Scorpio
 prefers sharing resources.Learning to enjoy life is what the north
 node in Taurus teaches you. It is important with this placement to be
