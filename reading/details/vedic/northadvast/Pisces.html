      and the south node, the intersection between the ecliptic and
      the Moon’s orbit. The nodes are fictional points, not celestial
      bodies, but they are an extremely important in astrology.The

      Let’s start with the north node. The north node
      reveals so much about your soul and its journey towards growth!

      lifetime. It shows where you can grow the most. However, this
      process is not easy at all. In the birth chart, the position of
      the north node often suggests challenges and struggles in the
      first part of your life (it usually gets better after the age of
      30).The south node, on the other hand, represents your past. If
      you believe in reincarnation, you can interpret the south node
      as your previous lives, but also your personal past in this
      life. The south node shows your karmic strengths. You usually
      excel at the things your south node represents, as you have a
      lot of experience with it. You are very comfortable here, but
      this doesn’t help you grow. This is why in this lifetime, you
      are supposed to focus on your north node (even though there is a
      strong pull to fall back on the south node).The lunar nodes
      spend in each sign approximately 18 months. Their orbital period
      is 18,6 years. They are directly opposite each other and they
      are always retrograde.In the birth chart, you can learn a lot
      about your karmic tasks by understanding your north node and
      south node. The lunar nodes’ house and sign are both very
      important (the house is more personal, but the sign is also
      telling).
