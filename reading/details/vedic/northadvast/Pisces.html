      This placement of the nodal axis suggests a very grounded, realistic
      person. You are so focused on the physical realm that your
      relationship with the divine is missing. This is one of the most
      challenging positions. The main focus with a Pisces north node is the
      path towards enlightenment. You can experience rebirth if you are
      willing to give up your old patterns.The north node in Pisces suggests
      that you have to illuminate your self-destructive tendencies and learn
      to accept yourself fully. This placement indicates that in this
      lifetime, you are more absorbed in studying the divine than in the
      physical reality. You are very analytical and want to find pattern in
      everything. However, there are some things that cannot be understood
      by the rational mind, and if you approach them only with the left
      hemisphere of your brain, you jeopardize not understanding them at
      all.The north node in Pisces automatically means that you have your
      south node in Virgo. This position is somewhat similar to the north
      node in twelfth house.

      AstrologyWhat is the north node in astrology and why is it so
      important?There are two lunar nodes in astrology, the north node
      and the south node, the intersection between the ecliptic and
      the Moon’s orbit. The nodes are fictional points, not celestial
      bodies, but they are an extremely important in astrology.The
      Moon’s nodes have to do with the spiritual journey of the soul,
      its past and future, the lessons it has learned and it is yet to
      learn. These points are especially important in karmic astrology
      (if reincarnation is something you don’t believe in, you can
      also treat the nodes as your past and future in this
      lifetime).

      Let’s start with the north node. The north node
      reveals so much about your soul and its journey towards growth!
      This node represents the traits you want to develop in this
      lifetime. It shows where you can grow the most. However, this
      process is not easy at all. In the birth chart, the position of
      the north node often suggests challenges and struggles in the
      first part of your life (it usually gets better after the age of
      30).The south node, on the other hand, represents your past. If
      you believe in reincarnation, you can interpret the south node
      as your previous lives, but also your personal past in this
      life. The south node shows your karmic strengths. You usually
      excel at the things your south node represents, as you have a
      lot of experience with it. You are very comfortable here, but
      this doesn’t help you grow. This is why in this lifetime, you
      are supposed to focus on your north node (even though there is a
      strong pull to fall back on the south node).The lunar nodes
      spend in each sign approximately 18 months. Their orbital period
      is 18,6 years. They are directly opposite each other and they
      are always retrograde.In the birth chart, you can learn a lot
      about your karmic tasks by understanding your north node and
      south node. The lunar nodes’ house and sign are both very
      important (the house is more personal, but the sign is also
      telling).

      the rest of the chart. Planets conjunct or squaring the nodes
      are significant.Pisces in the ZodiacAs the last sign of the
      Zodiac, Pisces is in many ways special. It belongs to a
      different realm above our everyday physical existence. There is
      a strong duality in Pisces that is not easy to deal with. Its
      symbol in astrology represents to fish who are bound together
      but swim in the opposite direction.In the natural chart, Pisces
      is connected with the twelfth house (it is the twelfth sign of
      the Zodiac). Its ruling planet is Neptune. Previously Pisces was
      ruled by Jupiter, and in traditional astrology, Jupiter is still
      the planetary ruler of Pisces.Pisces is associated with
      sensitivity, intuition, dreams, sleeping, imagination, fantasy,
      creativity, divine inspiration, spirituality, unconditional
      love. The negative side of Pisces includes getting lost,
      escapism, addictions, illusion, maladaptive daydreaming.Pisces
      is also connected with the sea, fish, maritime matters, liquids,
      petrol, drugs, alcohol.If you found this article helpful, maybe
