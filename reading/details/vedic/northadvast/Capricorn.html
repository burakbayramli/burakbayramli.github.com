  NodeWhat are the lunar nodes in astrology?The lunar nodes, also
  called the Moon’s nodes are the intersection between the Moon’s
  orbit and the ecliptic. They are fictional points, not existing
  celestial bodies.In astrology, the lunar nodes are associated with
  life lessons and spiritual growth. These points are very important
  in the birth chart, and they are frequently used in karmic
  astrology, as they are associated with your past lives and current
  incarnation. If you don’t believe in reincarnation, treat the nodes
  as the indicators of your past in this life and the direction your
  future self grows towards.The south node represents the things you
  have already learned and as such, it is usually a living area where
  you excel without much effort. The sign of the south node is already
