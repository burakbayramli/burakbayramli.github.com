      present, you need to create peace.People with this position need

      solving problems on your own. You are a born warrior with the
      south node in Aries.The south node in Aries often suggests that
      you were alone in the past, and you lived a very independent
      life. Independence and freedom are still important to you, and
      it is a challenge to don’t let this stop you from maintaining
      meaningful relationships. You are great at taking care of your
      needs, but when you have to make your partner feel comfortable,

      suggests a harsh upbringing, where criticism and punishment were
      used instead of understanding. Perhaps your family didn’t
      provide you what you needed and you had to fight for things on
      your own. People with this position were sometimes judged for
      being emotional and vulnerable. With the north node in Libra,
      there is a tendency to see life as a battlefield. People with

      are some other restricting influences in the chart) and you are
      always after a new challenge. In the meantime, it is also
      important to conserve your inner balance. It is helpful to work
      on your emotional intelligence with this position.If you don’t
      open up to the idea of cooperating and listening to others,

      leaving. People with this position often end up on their own
      until they learn how to make compromises. This can lead to
      painful life experiences that force you to evolve
      yourself.

      Dealing with your north node in Libra usually becomes easier in
      the second part of your life. As you mature, you start to
      develop the strengths of Libra, and Aries stays more and more in
      the background. You don’t have to completely abandon your south
      node, per se, but it becomes less influential. You start to
      realize that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar.It
      can be helpful to take part in activities that help you
      cultivate the traits of Libra. You want experiences that teach
      you how to be diplomatic, graceful, cooperative. If you become

      will be more attracted to you, and they will help you achieve
      your goals.It can be also helpful to take up hobbies that let
      you get in touch with your creative, artistic side.Besides the
      sign of the north node, its house is also an important influence
      over how it plays out in your natal chart. Pay attention to any
      planet aspecting the north node, as they add more detail to how
      your north node in Libra is likely to play out.The Lunar Nodes
      in AstrologyThe Moon’s nodes are of great importance in the
      birth chart, despite that they don’t exist in reality. There are
      two lunar nodes, the north node and the south node. These points
      are calculated as the intersection between the orbit of the Moon
      and the ecliptic.

      <p>
      The lunar nodes spend approximately 18 months in each sign of
      the Zodiac. This means that their orbital period is around 18,6
      months. The north node and the south node are also referred to
      as Rahu and Ketu.What do the lunar nodes represent in
      astrology?In the birth chart, the north node shows what are the
      lessons you need to learn in this incarnation. The south node
      shows your past, the things you already do excel at. If you
      don’t believe in reincarnation, you can treat the nodes as your
      early life and childhood, and the north node as the direction
      you will likely grow towards later as you get older.The north
      node is key when it comes to understanding your chart. This
      point is rarely an area with an easy flow of energy. Quite the
      contrary, most people struggle with the life area and the traits
      represented by the north node when young. Deep down, it makes
      you happy and fulfilled if your life is aligned with your north
      node. Planets conjunct the north node or aspecting it are also
      important when analyzing the north node in the natal chart.At
      the same time, there is a strong pull to fall back on your south
      node. The south node is your comfort zone, it feels familiar,
      but you can’t grow if you keep repeating the same things you
      already do well.
