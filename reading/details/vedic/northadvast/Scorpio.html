      often make your life harder than it needs to be, especially when
      young.In this lifetime, you can learn that there are faster, more
      effective ways of achieving your goals and that life doesn’t have to
      be hard all the time. However, it takes a lot of time to realize this,
      as you prefer your own way of doing things, and you often dismiss the
      advice of others.People with a Scorpio north node often find it very
      hard to trust others and to ask for help. They want to be self-reliant
      all the time. In the past, material possessions made them feel safe
      and secure and they took pride in providing for themselves and their
      loved ones. In this lifetime, they need to realize that they are more
      resourceful than they believe and even if they have to start from
      scratch, they can bounce back. With the help of others, they can
      achieve their goals more easily, no matter what happens to them.With a
